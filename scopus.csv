However, it is not clear whether sports practice in childhood and adolescence could be inversely related to CRF in adult life. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the association between early sports practice and cardiovascular risk factors in a randomized sample of community-dwelling adults. Methods: For this, 265 adults aged ≥ 18 years composed the sample. Cardiovascular risk factors of obesity, central obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension were collected. Early sports practice was retrospectively self-reported using an appropriate instrument. Total physical activity level was assessed by accelerometry. The association between early sports practice and cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood was analyzed by binary logistic regression, adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Results: Early sports practice was observed in 56.2% of the sample. The prevalence of central obesity (31.5 vs. 50.0%; p = 0.003), diabetes (4.7% vs. 13.7%; p = 0.014), dyslipidemia (10.7% vs. 24.1%; p = 0.005), and hypertension (14.1% vs. 34.5%; p = 0.001) was lower in participants who reported early sports practice. Participants who reported early sports practice in childhood and adolescence were, respectively, 60% (OR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.19–0.82) and 59% (OR = 0.41; 95% CI 0.21–0.82) less likely to have hypertension in adult life when compared to those with no early sports practice, independently of sex, age, socioeconomic status, and habitual physical activity level in adulthood. Conclusion: Early sports practice in childhood and adolescence was a protective factor for hypertension in adulthood. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cardiometabolic; Health; Motor behavior; Physical activity; Youth","accelerometry; adult; Article; athletics; basketball; body height; body mass; body weight; cardiovascular risk factor; cholesterol diet; community dwelling person; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; early sports practice; female; gymnastics; human; human experiment; hypertension; judo; karate; male; obesity; physical activity; retrospective study; soccer; social status; swimming; tennis; triacylglycerol blood level; volleyball; waist circumference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85148737601

Knee pain in several studies have been seen to be more prevalent in active adolescents compared to inactive, although common in both groups. Nevertheless, few studies with large sample size have been published reporting the difference of the prevalence of knee pain for each sport among young sports players. This study investigated the point prevalence of knee pain among young sports players aged 6–15 years old according to age, sex, and sports discipline. Furthermore, this study investigated the association between knee pain and sports discipline among young sports players. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire on young sports players aged 6–15 years from the Miyagi Amateur Sports Association. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between knee pain and sports discipline and were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), training days per week, and training hours per weekday and weekend. Results: A total of 7234 young sports players were included. The point prevalence of knee pain was 10.9%. Females (13.3%) had more knee pain than males (9.8%). Young, 13-year-old sports players had the highest prevalence of knee pain (19.1%). The multivariable analysis showed that the highest odds ratio [95% confidence interval] was observed for handball players (2.42 [1.01–5.81]). In addition, hand ball, mini-basketball (odds ratio 1.85; 95% CI 1.38–2.47), and basketball (odds ratio 1.66; 95% CI 1.23–2.26) were significantly associated with knee pain, compared with football. The lowest odds ratio was observed for swimming (0.34 [0.05–2.54]), followed by karate (odds ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.16–0.89) and baseball (odds ratio 0.47; 95% CI 0.35–0.64). Conclusion: The prevalence of knee pain among young athletes differed according to age, sex, and sports discipline. Their parents and clinicians should recognize this information to manage knee pain among young sports players. © 2023, The Author(s).","Knee pain; Sports discipline; Young sports players","adolescent; age; Article; athlete; baseball; basketball; body mass; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; football; human; Japan; karate; knee pain; major clinical study; male; point prevalence; questionnaire; sex; sport; swimming; training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147560501

However, few ecological studies address this problem by considering the players’ characteristics (e.g., practice experience, skill and cognition). Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the dose-response effect of two different types of practice, each with different learning objectives, on mental load and motor performance by using a linear mixed model analysis. Method: Forty-four university students (age 20.36 ± 3.13 years) participated in this study. Two sessions were conducted, one based on a standard rules 1 × 1 basketball situation (“practice to maintain”) and one with motor, temporal and spatial restrictions in 1 × 1 tasks (“practice to learn”). Results: “Practice to learn” produced a higher perceived mental load (NASA-TLX scale) and a worse performance than “practice to maintain”, but was moderated by experience and inhibition (p = 0.001). The same happens in the most demanding restriction (i.e., temporal, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The results showed that increasing the difficulty of 1 × 1 situations through restrictions harmed the player’s performance and increased their perceived mental load. These effects were moderated by previous basketball experience and the player’s inhibition capacity, so the difficulty adjustment should be based on the athletes themselves. © 2023 by the authors.","basketball; mental load; motor performance; motor practice; restrictions; skill acquisition; training","adult; article; athlete; basketball; clinical article; controlled study; dose response; human; human experiment; learning; mental load; motor performance; university student; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85149758844

The purpose of this exploratory study is to evaluate a diagnostic test battery based on a Delphi consensus at the time of unrestricted return to team training after acute shoulder injury. Methods and analysis Data for this prospective multicentre cohort study are collected at two measurement time points: when the respective physician clears the patient for RTP (t1) and 12 months after RTP (t2). The study participants are 18-35 years old athletes participating at a professional level in the following team sports: handball, basketball, ice hockey, soccer, volleyball and American football. Maximum comparability will be ensured via uninjured matched pair teammates. To assess the subjective assessment of shoulder functioning and the athlete's readiness to RTP, patient-reported outcome measures (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index, Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, Psychological Readiness of Injured Athlete to Return to Sport and Shoulder Instability-Return to Sport after Injury) will be completed. After a medical check-up with a range of motion and anthropometric measurements as well as clinical tests, the participants will perform a structured warm-up protocol. The functional tests comprise handgrip strength, upper quarter Y-balance test, isometric strength, closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test, wall hop test, functional throwing performance index and the unilateral seated shot put test and isokinetic tests. Ethics and dissemination The results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and scientific presentations at national and international conferences.

A contrast between the new Olympic format three-on-three (3 × 3) and five-on-five (5v5) forms of basketball has never been analyzed and provides a comparison within the same form of sports. Methods: We developed a new method to calculate performance indicators for each team and invented the Relative Score Difference Index, a new competitive balance indicator that allows the comparison of luck in the two basketball forms for both men and women. We collected game-level data about 3 × 3 and 5v5 from the World Cups held between 2010 and 2019 (N = 666). Luck was defined as the difference between the expected and the actual outcomes of games. Using the basketball World Cup data, we applied the Surprise Index, ran probit regression models, and compared the basketball forms on the goodness-of-fit of the models. Results: As we predicted, there are differential effects of luck between game formats and sex, such that the 3 × 3 form depends more on luck and women’s games are less influenced by luck when compared to men’s games. Conclusion: Coaches may better understand the differences between the two forms and sexes regarding luck if they are aware that the 3 × 3 and men’s competitions are usually more influenced by luck. The findings provide a leverage point for testing new performances and competition balance indicators and will acknowledge the number of games we enjoy watching. © 2023 by the authors.","chance; competitive balance; International Basketball Federation (FIBA); uncertainty of outcome; World Cup","adult; article; basketball; competition; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; performance indicator; regression model; uncertainty; athletic performance; soccer; Athletic Performance; Basketball; Female; Humans; Male; Soccer; Team Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85148963931

This study evaluated changes in Ontario children’s physical activity levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored the impact of family sociodemographic markers on children’s activity. Parents (n = 243; Mage = 38.8 years) of children aged 12 and under (n = 408; Mage = 6.7 years) living in Ontario, Canada, completed two online surveys between August and December 2020 (survey 1) and August and December 2021 (survey 2). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate changes in the proportion of children who accumulated 60 min of physical activity per day pre-lockdown, during lockdown, and post-lockdown in Ontario. Results revealed a significant non-linear trajectory whereby the proportion of children achieving 60 min of physical activity per day pre-lockdown (63%) declined during lockdown (21%) and then increased post-lockdown (54%). Changes in the proportion of children engaging in 60 min of daily physical activity were moderated by several demographic variables. Efforts are needed to provide parents of young children with a wider variety of resources to ensure children are obtaining sufficient levels of physical activity regardless of the presence of community lockdowns. © 2023 by the authors.","children; COVID-19; Ontario; pandemic; physical activity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85148748561

Eighteen female basketball players from a Sport College were randomly divided into two groups: VBRT (n = 10) and PBRT (n = 8). The six-week intervention consisted of two sessions per week of free-weight back squats with linear periodization from 65% to 95%1RM. In PBRT, the weights lifted were fixed based on 1RM percentage, while in VBRT, the weights were adjusted based on individualized velocity profiles. The T-30m sprint time, relative power of countermovement jump (RP-CMJ), and Wingate test were evaluated. The Wingate test assessed peak power (PP), mean power (MP), fatigue index (FI), maximal velocity (Vmax), and total work (TW). Results showed that VBRT produced a very likely improvement in RP-CMJ, Vmax, PP, and FI (Hedges’ g = 0.55, 0.93, 0.68, 0.53, respectively, p < 0.01). On the other hand, PBRT produced a very likely improvement in MP (Hedges’ g = 0.38) and TW (Hedges’ g = 0.45). Although VBRT showed likely favorable effects in RP-CMJ, PP, and Vmax compared to PBRT (p < 0.05 for interaction effect), PBRT produced greater improvements in MP and TW (p < 0.05 for interaction effect). In conclusion, PBRT may be more effective in maintaining high-power velocity endurance, while VBRT has a greater impact on explosive power adaptations. © 2023 by the authors.","autoregulation; fixed-loading; load monitoring; load-velocity relationship; resistance training; Wingate anaerobic performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85148712157

The publications search period ranged from January 2007 to December 2021. The search covered the following electronic databases: SCOPUS, SportDiscus, and the Web of Science core collection. Following this search process, 18 articles were included in the review. The following variables were analysed: characteristics of the sample, the constraints manipulated, the duration of the intervention, and the effect on technical–tactical actions. The studies reviewed modified the following constraints: (a) number of players (66.7%), (b) court dimensions (27.8%), (c) ball/player interactions (11.1%), and (d) ball/player interactions, basket height, game time and number of baskets (5.6%, respectively). The findings show that rule manipulation can increase players’ participation and promote the variability of players’ actions. The current evidence about rule modification in youth basketball presents areas in which more studies are needed to have a complete perspective of their impact in practice and competition through the different stages of players’ development. Taking into account individual needs and developmental stages, further studies should consider different age groups (e.g., from U-10 to zU-14) and female players. Expanding scientific knowledge in this area would help coaches make short- and long-term plans in accordance with players’ developmental stages. © 2023 by the authors.","children; competition; scaling equipment; sport; training",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85148709733

Based on the Dualistic Model of Passion, it was hypothesized that in the context of collective sports, harmonious passion should lead to the adoption of mostly mastery goals, which in turn should lead to a more team-oriented decision-making. Conversely, obsessive passion should be related to the adoption of all three types of goals but mostly to performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals, which in turn should lead to a more self-oriented decision process. A total of 253 basketball players completed measures of passion and achievement goals in sport.

Data of the hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and serum ferritin (sFer) levels of male (n = 350) and female (n = 126) basketball and football players, aged 11–18, from two sport medicine centers in Israel were gathered and analyzed. Mild ID was defined as sFer ≤ 30 µg/L, moderate as sFer ≤ 20 µg/L, and severe as sFer ≤ 10 µg/L. IDA was defined as sFer ≤ 20 µg/L and Hb < 13 g/dL for males and sFer ≤ 20 µg/L and Hb < 12 g/dL for females. The prevalence of mild ID was 41.1% and 53.2%, moderate was 17.4% and 27.8%, and severe was 2% and 4.8% in males and females, respectively. The prevalence of IDA was 2.6% in males and 4% in females. Mild and moderate ID was significantly higher among females. In conclusion, non-anemic ID, which is known to be common among female athletes, especially in sports requiring leanness, is also highly prevalent among adolescent males playing ball games. Therefore, screening for hemoglobin and sFer is recommended for young athletes of both genders and in all sports. © 2023 by the authors.","adolescents; anemia; athletes; ferritin; iron deficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147817413

For decades, there have been movements towards integrating people with a disability in mainstream society. There has been a lack of research supporting the movement of able-bodied involvement in disability sport, known as reverse integration. In this study, the real-life experiences and motivations of 11 national wheelchair basketball players (four able-bodied and seven with a disability) were explored, identifying the potential of reverse integration and what influenced the players involvement. Thematic analysis was employed using a deductive approach. The social-relational model was used as a framework to help interpret the findings. The results highlighted that health and social benefits were key factors towards prolonged engagement in wheelchair basketball, and it was reported that reverse integration led to an increased mutual understanding of the impact of (dis)ability. All participants reported positive experiences and supported able-bodied involvement, suggesting that able-bodied players play a key role and help to grow the sport locally. However, involvement of able-bodied players was not supported at international level. This challenges the concept of inclusion at higher level and whether the sport could be more inclusive. These findings could provide direction to coaches and policymakers for developing further inclusive opportunities at all levels. Further research may explore coach education programs and learning experiences of becoming an inclusive coach to ensure coaches know how to create, stimulate and coach in inclusive sport environments. © 2023 by the authors.","adapted physical activity; inclusion; motivational influences; reverse integration; sport participation; wheelchair basketball","disability; inclusion; movement; physical activity; sport; adult; Article; awareness; clinical article; controlled study; disability; female; health care personnel; health care policy; health program; human; integration; learning; male; motivation; patient participation; perception; personal experience; pilot study; social aspect; social interaction; sport; thematic analysis; wheelchair basketball; basketball; disabled person; wheelchair; Basketball; Disabled Persons; Humans; Wheelchairs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147801280

Methods: A total of 43 male college basketball athletes in Macau were selected as the participants. Besides the regular basketball training, the intervention group (n = 23) received a 7-week mindfulness training; the weekly mindfulness intervention session lasted around one hour according to the mindfulness training manual for athletes, while the control group (n = 20) did not receive any mindfulness training. Before and immediately after the 7-week intervention, all players performed the following tests: the “Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire”, the “Acceptance and Action Questionnaire”, the “Sport Competition Anxiety Test”, the “Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale”, and three shooting tests. An independent-sample t-test and a paired-sample t-test were used to analyze the between- and within-group differences. Moreover, a repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the group, time, and group-by-time effects on psychological skills and shooting performances. Results: The intervention resulted in both significant between-group and within-group differences in mindfulness level, acceptance level, attention level, three-point, and free-throw shooting performances (all p < 0.05, Cohen’s d ranging from 0.565 to 1.117). Conclusion: While further study is necessary, the present study suggests that the 7-week mindfulness training program can significantly improve psychological outcomes and shooting performance in Macau college basketball athletes. Future studies involving competition settings and objective metrics will aid in verifying mindfulness as the prevalent practice among basketball practitioners and athletes. © 2023 by the authors.","acceptance; anxiety; basketball shooting performance; intervention; mindfulness","experimental study; male; mens health; mental health; psychology; sport; training; acceptance and action questionnaire; adult; analysis of variance; anxiety; article; athlete; attention; basketball; clinical article; competition; controlled study; coping behavior; experimental design; human; Macao; male; Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; mindfulness; physician; quasi experimental study; skill; training; athlete; athletic performance; Macao; procedures; psychology; China; Macau; Athletes; Athletic Performance; Basketball; Humans; Macau; Male; Mindfulness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147796335

Methods: Physicians for the MLS, MLL, MLR, WO, and WNBA were identified and characterized based on training background, practice setting, years of experience, and geographic location. Social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and ResearchGate were determined. Differences between social media users and non-users were analyzed via chi-squared tests for nonparametric variables. Secondary analysis consisted of univariate logistic regression to identify associated factors. Results: 86 team physicians were identified. 73.3% of physicians had at least one social media profile. 80.2% of physicians were orthopedic surgeons. Specifically, 22.1% had a professional Facebook page, 24.4% had a professional Twitter page, 58.1% had a LinkedIn profile, 25.6% a ResearchGate profile, and 9.3% an Instagram account. All physicians with a social media presence were fellowship-trained. Conclusions: Seventy-three percent of team physicians in the MLS, MLL, MLR, WO, or WNBA have social media presence, with over half using LinkedIn. Fellowship-trained physicians were significantly more likely to use social media, and 100% of physicians with social media presence were fellowship trained. MLS and WO team physicians were significantly more likely to use LinkedIn (P =.02). MLS team physicians were significantly more likely to use social media overall (P =.004).

Methods A planned secondary analysis of 7799 children from 5 years old to <18 years old with head injuries enrolled in a prospective multicentre study between 2011 and 2014. Sports-related TBIs were identified by the epidemiology codes for activity, place and injury mechanism. The sports cohort was stratified into two age groups (younger: 5-11 and older: 12-17 years). Acute care costs from the publicly funded Australian health system perspective are presented in 2018 pound sterling (£). Results There were 2903 children (37%) with sports-related TBIs. Mean age was 12.0 years (95% CI 11.9 to 12.1 years); 78% were male. Bicycle riding was associated with the most TBIs (14%), with mean per-patient costs of £802 (95% CI £644 to £960) and 17% of acute costs. The highest acute costs (21%) were from motorcycle-related TBIs (3.8% of injuries), with mean per-patient costs of £3795 (95% CI £1850 to £5739). For younger boys and girls, bicycle riding was associated with the highest TBIs and total costs; however, the mean per-patient costs were highest for motorcycle and horse riding, respectively. For older boys, rugby was associated with the most TBIs. However, motorcycle riding had the highest total and mean per-patient acute costs. For older girls, horse riding was associated with the most TBIs and highest total acute costs, and motorcycle riding was associated with the highest mean per-patient costs. Conclusion Injury prevention strategies should focus on age-related and sex-related sports activities to reduce the burden of TBIs in children.

This genetic condition leads to recurrent upper and lower respiratory infections, bronchiectasis, laterality defect, and subfertility. Male infertility is often associated with PCD, since the ultrastructure of the axoneme in the sperm tail is similar to that of the motile cilia of respiratory cells. We present the first reported case of a male patient from a non-consanguineous Italian family who exhibited a severe form of asthenozoospermia factor infertility but no situs inversus and absolutely no signs of the clinical respiratory phenotype, the proband being a professional basketball player. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has identified a homozygote mutation (CCDC103 c.461 A>C, p.His154Pro) in the proband, while his brother was a heterozygous carrier for this mutation. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses of the axoneme in the sperm flagellum demonstrated the complete loss of both the inner and outer dynein arms (IDA and ODA, respectively). Moreover, immunofluorescence of DNAH1, which is used to check the assembly of IDA, and DNAH5, which labels ODA, demonstrated that these complexes are absent along the full length of the flagella in the spermatozoa from the proband, which was consistent with the IDA and ODA defects observed. Noteworthy, TEM analysis of the axoneme from respiratory cilia showed that dynein arms, although either IDAs and/or ODAs seldom missing on some doublets, are still partly present in each observed section. This case reports the total sperm immotility associated with the CCDC103 p.His154Pro mutation in a man with a normal respiratory phenotype and enriches the variant spectrum of ccdc103 variants and the associated clinical phenotypes in PCD, thus improving counseling of patients about their fertility and possible targeted treatments.

Methods: The researchers used the experimental method on 24 basketball players. They were randomly divided into two groups: one experimental (n = 12, age = 10.92 ± 0.79 years; height = 138.50 ± 2.78 cm; weight = 40.25 ± 2.01 kg) and a control group (n = 12, age = 11.17 ± 0. 72 years; length = 139.92 ± 3.53 cm; weight = 40.50 ±. 1.73 kg). The homogeneity between the two groups was calculated and showed that there were no differences between the two samples. In the research variables, the proposed program was applied for 10 weeks at the rate of 4 weekly training units. Results and Discussion: The proposed training program had a positive impact on the harmonic abilities and basic skills of basketball players and the differences in improvement rates for all variables were in favor of the experimental group. Therefore, the research suggests that Small-sided games using FITLIGHT positively affect all the variables under research. This leads to significant differences between the post-tests and benefits the experimental group. 2023 Hassan, Alibrahim and Sayed Ahmed.","basketball; fitLight; harmonic abilities; skills development; small games",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147429188

Methods: Fifteen participants were assigned to the VBRT (n = 8) or PBRT (n = 7) groups. The load in VBRT group were determined through the sessional target velocity and velocity loss monitoring, whereas PBRT group used a fixed-load based on percentage of 1-repetition maximum (1RM). Both groups completed intervention that involved the free weight back squat and bench press using the same relative load (linear periodization from 65% to 95% 1RM). Training loads data was continuously recorded. Measurements at baseline (T0) and post-training (T2) included 1RM, countermovement-jump (CMJ), squat-jump (SJ), eccentric-utilization-ratio (EUR), drop-jump height and reactive-strength-index (DJ, DJ-RSI), plyometric-push-up (PPU), 505 change-of-direction (COD), 10-m、20-m sprint (T-10、T-20), 17 × 15 m drill-lines (17-drill), Hexagon agility, and functional movement screen (FMS). A mid-term (T1) assessment was included to investigate the short-term effects of both methods and the fluctuation of personalized 1RM. Results: No between-group differences were observed at T0 for descriptive variables (p > 0.05). Both groups showed significant improvement in strength gains for back squat and bench press, but VBRT showed likely to very likely favorable improvements in CMJ, SJ, EUR, DJ-RSI, Hexagon and COD among athletic performance. The VBRT showed likely to very likely improvements in 17-drill and DJ, while PBRT showed unclear effects. The lifted weights adjusted by VBRT method were higher than prescribed by PBRT (p < 0.05) for the same subjects. Conclusion: Compared with fixed-load PBRT, VBRT enhanced power and athletic performance despite similar strength gains. VBRT can be regarded as a more functional resistance-training method under linear periodization.

Anthropometry, age, estimated maturity status, and basketball-specific physical fitness (assessed with the countermovement jump, line drill, and yo-yo intermittent recovery level-1 and fitness score) were considered. Players were grouped by the onset of specialization as related to biological maturation milestones (pre-puberty, mid-puberty, and late-puberty specialization). The within-season and developmental changes in physical fitness were fitted using multilevel modeling in a fully Bayesian framework. The fitness outcomes were similar between-player and within-player changes when grouped by specialization across a season. Fitness improvements across a season were apparent for female players, while male players maintained their performance levels. There was no variation in the patterns of physical fitness development between 11 and 17 years associated with the onset of specialization.

It is common in adults 50-70 years of age with a male to female ratio 2:1. Here, we report a 14-year-old Caucasian female who presented with a painless, growing, friable, hemorrhagic nodule on her right medial buccal cheek of 2 weeks’ duration. The lesion was traumatized during a basketball game and significant bleeding was noted. A shave biopsy was performed on the 1.7 cm x 1.3 cm lesion. Histopathology demonstrated epidermal necrosis, acanthosis, large atypical lymphocytes with a number mitoses, prominent eosinophils, and smaller lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical staining revealed CD30 positivity of much of the tumor infiltrate, but was not diffusely positive. Rare cells were granzyme positive. ALK-1, TdT, EBER, CD1a were negative. The diagnosis was confirmed by a second dermatopathologist. The patient was referred to oncology. Labs were within normal limits and PET/CT scan was negative for metastasis. The lesion started to spontaneously regress after the shave biopsy. Spontaneous regression of C-ALCL occurs in 20-42% of cases and usually has an indolent course, therefore, aggressive treatment is not appropriate. In most cases, solitary or localized lesions are treated with surgical excision or radiotherapy. Although, about half of cases reoccur, but are not life threatening. This unusual case of C-ALCL provides an additional example of a rare clinical presentation in an adolescent female and reiterates the important histopathological findings for diagnosis. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.","anaplastic large cell lymphoma; CD30 lymphoproliferative disorders",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85146261245

The study also tested non-participation versus participation in basketball as an independent predictor of peak power output. METHODS: The sample of this cross-sectional study was composed of 63 male participants (basketball: n=32, 17.0±0.9 years; school: n=31, 17.4±1.0 years). Anthropometry included stature, body mass, circumferences, lengths, and skinfolds. Fat-free mass was estimated from skinfolds and lower limbs volume predicted from circumferences and lengths. Participants completed the force-velocity test using a cycle ergometer to determine peak power output. RESULTS: For the total sample, optimal peak power was correlated to body size (body mass: r=0.634; fat-free mass: r=0.719, lower limbs volume: r=0.577). The best model was given by fat-free mass and explained 51% of the inter-individual variance in force-velocity test. The preceding was independent of participating in sports (i.e., the dummy variable basketball vs. school did not add significant explained variance). CONCLUSION: Adolescent basketball players were taller and heavier than school boys. The groups also differed in fat-free mass (school: 53.8±4.8 kg; basketball: 60.4±6.7 kg), which was the most prominent predictor of inter-individual variance in peak power output.

For instance, the repetitive head impacts in contact sports might contribute to glymphatic clearance impairment and cognitive decline. This study aimed to assess the effect of contact sports participation in youth on glymphatic function in old age and the relationship between glymphatic function and cognitive status using the analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index. Materials and methods: A total of 52 Japanese older male subjects were included in the study, including 12 who played heavy-contact sports (mean age, 71.2 years), 15 who played semicontact sports (mean age, 73.1 years), and 25 who played noncontact sports (mean age, 71.3 years) in their youth. All brain diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) of the subjects were acquired using a 3T MRI scanner. The ALPS indices were calculated using a validated semiautomated pipeline. The ALPS indices from the left and right hemispheres were compared between groups using a general linear model, including age and years of education. Furthermore, partial Spearman's rank correlation tests were performed to assess the correlation between the ALPS indices and cognitive scores (Mini-Mental State Examination and the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA-J]) after adjusting for age years of education and HbA1c. Results: The left ALPS index was significantly lower in the heavy-contact and semicontact groups than that in the noncontact group. Although no significant differences were observed in the left ALPS index between the heavy-contact and semicontact groups and in the right ALPS index among groups, a trend toward lower was found in the right ALPS index in individuals with semicontact and heavy-contact compared to the noncontact group. Both sides' ALPS indices were significantly positively correlated with the MoCA-J scores. Conclusion: The findings indicated the potential adverse effect of contact sports experience in youth on the glymphatic system function in old age associated with cognitive decline.

A total of 20 male and female basketball players (10 female and 10 male) and 20 sedentary control subjects (10 female and 10 male) were included in the study. The athletes exercised at least five times per week for 2 h per day. Saliva samples were collected mid-season, between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. and away from sport competition. The proteome and metabolome were analyzed by using 2DE and GC–MS techniques, respectively. A computerized 2DE gel image analysis revealed 43 spots that varied in intensity among groups. Between these spots, 10 (23.2%) were differentially expressed among male athletes and controls, 22 (51.2%) between female basketball players and controls, 11 spots (25.6%) between male and female athletes, and 13 spots (30.2%) between male and female controls. Among the proteins identified were Immunoglobulin, Alpha-Amylase, and Dermcidin, which are inflammation-related proteins. In addition, several amino acids, such as glutamic acid, lysine, ornithine, glycine, tyrosine, threonine, and valine, were increased in trained athletes. In this study, we highlight that saliva is a useful biofluid to assess athlete performance and confirm that the adaptation of men and women to exercise has some common features, but also some different sex-specific behaviors, including differential amino acid utilization and expression of inflammation-related proteins, which need to be further investigated. Moreover, in the future, it will be interesting to examine the influence of sport-type on these differences. © 2023 by the authors.","basketball; metabolomics; physical exercise; proteomics; saliva; sex; sport; training",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85146810023

The objectives of this research were to characterize physical fitness and game indicators based on the game position. This is an empirical study, with a quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional methodology. In addition, different relationships between the level of physical fitness and the game indicators during the competition were determined. Finally, a predictive analysis of the selected variables was carried out in order to know the importance of the variables in the performance and at what time of the season they had the greatest impact. For this, a professional female basketball team (n = 12) with a mean age of 25.25 ± 7.617 years, height 178.25 ± 9.206 cm and a body mass of 72.33 ± 11.657 kg was analyzed. Each player was equipped with a WIMUPRO inertial device, and all competition statistics were analyzed. The results obtained show that there were no differences among all the skills evaluated and game indicators depending on the game position. Likewise, a relationship was determined between the level of physical fitness and the technical–tactical contribution, being different between different times of the season. Moreover, physical fitness only predicted the player’s final performance in the competition for female player centers in the first and second rounds of the championship, and for forwards in the first round. Four physical-physiological profiles with contributions to the different ones during the competition were also determined. Finally, three groups of female players by playing position were identified according to their sport performance, namely PIR, high, medium and low ratings, associated with physical performances. In all groups, there were significant differences between playing positions, PIR and physical performances. © 2023 by the authors.","game indicators; game position; inertial device; match analysis; notational analysis; physical fitness; predictive analysis; woman","performance assessment; physical activity; prediction; sport; training; womens health; adult; article; athletic performance; basketball; basketball player; clinical article; competition; controlled study; empiricism; female; fitness; human; physical performance; season; skill; adolescent; athletic performance; basketball; cross-sectional study; fitness; physiology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Athletic Performance; Basketball; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Physical Fitness; Team Sports; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85146796954

Measurements were made three times in May 2022 at 28 sampling points in 5 different sporting areas (the climbing wall, swimming pool, swimming pool changing room, and basketball and badminton courts) depending on the time of day (morning or afternoon) and on the outside building. The obtained results were compared with the standards for air quality in sports facilities. The air temperature (21–31 °C) was at the upper limit of thermal comfort, while the air humidity (RH &lt; 40%) in the sports halls in most of the locations was below demanded values. The values for dust pollution in all rooms, except the swimming pool, exceeded the permissible limits, especially in the afternoons. Climatic conditions correlated with a high concentration of dust in the indoor air. Particulate matter concentrations of all fractions exceeded the WHO guidelines in all researched premises; the largest exceedances of standards occurred for PM2.5 (five-fold) and for PM10 (two-fold). There were no exceedances of gaseous pollutant concentrations in the air, except for benzopyrene, which resulted from the influence of the outside air. The total number of bacteria (5.1 × 101–2.0 × 104 CFU m−3) and fungi (3.0 × 101–3.75 × 102 CFU m−3) was exceeded in the changing room and the climbing wall hall. An increased number of staphylococci in the afternoon was associated with a large number of people training. The increased concentration of xerophilic fungi in the air correlated with the high dust content and low air humidity. Along with the increase in the number of users in the afternoon and their activities, the concentration of dust (several times) and microorganisms (1–2 log) in the air increased by several times and 1–2 log, respectively. The present study indicates which air quality parameters should be monitored and provides guidelines on how to increase the comfort of those who practice sports and work in sports facilities. © 2023 by the authors.","air quality; bioaerosol; biodiversity; chemical contamination; microclimatic parameters; particulate matter; sports facilities","benzo[a]pyrene; hydrogen sulfide; oxygen; ozone; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; Actinobacteria; air monitoring; air quality standard; air temperature; airflow; ambient air; Article; bacterial count; badminton; basketball; biodiversity; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dust; Enterobacteriaceae; flow rate; humidity; microbial contamination; microclimate; nonhuman; particulate matter 1.0; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; Poland; practice guideline; Pseudomonas fluorescens; sport facility; Staphylococcus aureus; swimming pool",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85146766006

The anthropometrics, vertical jump, agility, and sprint performance parameters collected from ten players during regular training sessions were ((Formula presented.) ± SD): height (193.7 ± 4.5 cm), weight (89.2 ± 4.1 cm), wingspan (196.5 ± 5.2 cm), squat jump (43.5 ± 4.6 cm), countermovement jump with (53.3 ± 4.4 cm) and without an arm swing (46.3 ± 4.0 cm), reactive strength index (2.4 ± 0.3 m/s), t-test (10.3 ± 0.3 s), 505 drill (2.4 ± 0.2 s), 10 m sprint (1.5 ± 0.1 s), 30 m sprint (4.0 ± 0.3 s), shuttle run (27.7 ± 1.7 s), and bench press (98.2 ± 10.0 kg) and back squat (139.5 ± 17.6 kg) one repetition maximum. Additionally, the average and maximal heart rate (HR) responses during simulated games were 160.6 ± 8.0 and 188.5 ± 6.3 bpm, with players spending 6.3 ± 4.2, 11.4 ± 5.2, 13.9 ± 3.5, 26.4 ± 10.4, and 42.1 ± 10.0% of the total time in HR Zones 1–5, respectively. Interestingly, no statistically significant differences in the aforementioned physical and performance parameters were noted between elite and non-elite players. Overall, the findings of the present study provide coaches, sports scientists, and strength and conditioning practitioners with information that can aid in the athlete selection process, detection of areas for further improvement, and development of training regimens that resemble 3×3 basketball on-court competitive demands. © 2023 by the authors.","agility; coaching; heart rate; sport; sprint; strength; training; vertical jump",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85146634988

A lot of research attention has been paid to training programs that may improve the vertical jump. However, the literature regarding the improvement of accuracy during the jump shot is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the combination of two training programs on explosive power of the lower extremities during the made jump shot. (2) Methods: A total of 61 male basketball players were assigned into training group (T, n = 31, age 15.32 ± 0.65) which was conducting a specific, i.e., experimental training program, and control group (C, n = 30, age 16.3 ± 0.71 years) involved in a regular training program. The experimental training program included specific plyometric training with shooting training which lasted for 10 weeks. The obtained data were processed by nonparametric statistics to determine the differences in the vertical jump outcomes, as well as to determine the level of impact of the experimental training program. Wilcoxon and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used. (3) Results: A significant improvement (p ≤ 0.05) was noticed in the T group, in every vertical jump variable (flight time, height of the jump, power, and speed of the jump during a jump shot for two and three points), while there was no improvement within the C group. (4) Conclusions: The combination of plyometric and shooting training has a positive impact on the explosive power of the lower extremities during the jump shot. © 2022 by the authors.","biomechanics; explosive strength; jumping performance; plyometric; young players","biomechanics; experimental study; performance assessment; physical activity; sport; training; young population; adolescent; article; basketball player; biomechanics; clinical article; human; jumping; Kruskal Wallis test; lower limb; male; nonparametric test; plyometrics; training; velocity; athletic performance; basketball; muscle strength; plyometrics; Adolescent; Athletic Performance; Basketball; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Muscle Strength; Plyometric Exercise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85145971782

Nevertheless, a distributed training proposal for the improvement of EFs is increasingly difficult to combine with seasonal sport commitments. This study aimed to investigate whether a massed basketball training program enriched with Fitlight training can improve EFs and motor performance. Forty-nine players (age = 15.0 ± 1.5 yrs) were assigned to the control and Fitlight-trained (FITL) groups, which performed 3 weeks of massed basketball practice, including 25 min per day of shooting sessions or Fitlight training, respectively. All athletes were tested in cognitive tasks (Flanker/Reverse Flanker; Digit Span) and fitness tests (Agility T-test; Yo-Yo IR1). During the intervention, exercise/session perceived effort (eRPE/sRPE) and enjoyment were collected. RM-ANOVA showed significant EFs scores increased in both groups over time, without differences between the groups. Moreover, an increased sRPE and eRPE appeared in the FITL group (p = 0.0001; p = 0.01), with no group differences in activity enjoyment and fitness tests. Three weeks of massed basketball training improved EFs and motor performance in young players. The additional Fitlight training increased the perceived cognitive effort without decreasing enjoyment, even if it seems unable to induce additional improvements in EFs. © 2023 by the authors.","cognitive-motor training; executive function; exercise; fitness; massed training; perceived effort","cognition; perception; sport; training; young population; adolescent; agility; analysis of variance; article; athlete; basketball; basketball player; cognition; cognitive effort; controlled study; executive function; exercise; human; human experiment; motor performance; training; athletic performance; basketball; exercise test; fitness; Adolescent; Athletic Performance; Basketball; Cognition; Exercise Test; Humans; Physical Fitness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85145970610

Methods: The sample consisted of 515 ball screens obtained in critical moments. LINCE software was used as a registration instrument by means of an observational instrument designed ad hoc. A descriptive analysis and chi-square tests (χ2) were performed with SPSS 25.0 and a T-patterns analysis with Theme 5 software. Results: The results indicate that the criteria that have the most influence on this type of action are the result of the team executing the screen (winning, losing or tying), the type of offense and the defence used on the ball screen. The most representative patterns of success tend to take place between 9–16 s of possession, with the screeners being inside players and the screened players being outside players, and it is performed in the upper areas of the court against an individual type of defence and ending with the screened player advancing towards the basket or passing to an open teammate.

The supraspinatus tendon is the most exposed to WB-related injuries and it is primarily responsible for SP in WB athletes. In these cases, SP rehabilitation remains the main treatment, but there is still a lack of specific protocols which should be customized to WB players’ peculiarities and to the supraspinatus muscle activity monitor, and the improvement of rehabilitation outcomes is slow. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify if the improvement of supraspinatus muscle activity, monitored in real time with surface electromyography (sEMG) during the execution of therapeutic exercises, could speed up SP rehabilitation outcomes in WB players. Thirty-three athletes were enrolled. They were divided into two groups. Both groups underwent the same shoulder rehabilitation program, but only the Exercise Plus sEMG Biofeedback Group executed therapeutic exercises while the activity of the supraspinatus muscles was monitored using sEMG. Participants were evaluated at enrollment (T0), at the end of 4 weeks of the rehabilitation program (T1), and 8 weeks after T1 (T2), using the following outcome measures: supraspinatus muscle activity as root mean square (RMS), Wheelchair User’s Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI), shoulder abduction, and external rotation range of motion (ROM). The Exercise Plus sEMG Biofeedback Group improved more and faster for all the outcomes compared to the Exercise Group. The monitoring and improvement of supraspinatus muscle activity seems to be an effective way to speed up SP rehabilitation outcomes in WB players, since it makes the performance of therapeutic exercise more precise and finalized, obtaining better and faster results in terms of recovery of shoulder function. © 2022 by the authors.","disability; Paralympics; rehabilitation; rotator cuff; shoulder pain; sport; wheelchair basketball","disability; health care; muscle; physical activity; sport; adult; Article; biofeedback; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; human; joint characteristics and functions; kinesiotherapy; male; muscle contraction; musculoskeletal disease assessment; outcome assessment; range of motion; shoulder abduction; shoulder external rotation; shoulder pain; supraspinatus muscle; surface electromyography; treatment outcome; wheelchair athlete; wheelchair basketball player; Wheelchair User Shoulder Pain Index; basketball; rotator cuff; shoulder pain; treatment outcome; wheelchair; Basketball; Humans; Range of Motion, Articular; Rotator Cuff; Shoulder Pain; Treatment Outcome; Wheelchairs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85145683876

In this phase, giving attention to the importance of athletes’ thoughts, emotions, and motivation can speed up the biopsychosocial rehabilitation process. Objective: To analyze the characteristics involved in the major sports injuries of high-level athletes to provide a reference for athletes and coaches during recovery. Methods: This article analyzes through bibliographic research the characteristics of the major sports injuries in high-le-vel athletes, including physiological, psychological, and social factors. Results: The physical impact of injuries requires patience and persistence for recovery, including additional muscle strengthening to compensate for the loss of residual joint proprioception, ensuring performance recovery. Mental factors such as insecurity when returning from games, reduced self-confidence, and fear of hurting the team must be worked through in parallel in multi-professional care and during long recovery periods. Conclusion: Sports injuries can occur in athletes of all levels. For elite athletes, the impact of injuries, especially severe ones that need to interrupt training or even surgery, will lead to forced suspension of training or competition, preventing the improvement of sports performance, decreasing the quality of the sports career, and may even lead to physical or psychological disability in severe cases.

A between-subject two-group unifactorial randomized block design with pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements was used. The intervention was carried out in a women's basketball team from l'Alqueria del Basket club in Valencia, of the high-level youth category (14-15 years). 6 players were assigned to the experimental group and each practiced shooting a ball into the basket from short and medium distance with one-handed technique for 15 sessions of 20 minutes, under perceptual, decisional and executive variability, while 3 players were assigned to the control group and practiced dribbling with changes of direction and rhythm under variability of practice conditions for the same amount of time. During the training, we manipulated the variables: distance to basket, ball size and weight, movements and positions before and during the throw, visual control of the throw, and physical overload of the players generated with additional weight or previous exercises. Wilcoxon and Chi-square techniques were used for the statistical treatment. The results revealed a worsening of the control group's self-efficacy, as well as a tendency for performance in the free-throw test to decrease. The experimental group improved its hit-miss percentage in free throw and 2 points field shots.

The percentage of throws is fundamental to know if the basketing movement can be correctly detected and judged. In traditional basketball, players’ skills are composed of specific movements. With the gradual development of these technical movements, coaches should pay more attention to each athlete so that their technical problems can be identified and worked on early. Objective: This article discusses how basketball players move, catch the ball on the court, and execute the shot to the basket. Methods: We randomly and voluntarily selected 90 basketball players by sampling. The independent variables, biomarkers, and kinetic patterns were properly cataloged and processed. The main test items included body, lower limb, and groin circumference. Finally, mathematical statistics were used to analyze the correlation of each index. The relationship between basketball players’ movement posture and basic offensive techniques was analyzed. Results: In basketball, basic attack techniques in multifactorial training remarkably influences their score. The role of score recovery in basketball is significant.

Training specifically targeted at basketball players is believed to have a superior effect on athlete performance. Objective: Explore the effect of applying optimized strength training to teaching college basketball. Methods: This experiment adopts the single variable method, and the control group uses the traditional strength training method. The experimental group combines training optimized for basketball needs. The duration of each strength training is 60 minutes, three times a week, for a total of 6 weeks. The college students’ baseline quality scores and basketball skills were measured before and after the intervention. Results: Both traditional and optimized strength training can effectively improve college players’ baseline quality and skills. Since optimized strength training is more targeted, the improvement of basketball skills is more evident. Conclusion: Optimized basketball strength training can effectively fill the deficiencies of traditional strength training and increase the performance of its athletes, and research is needed for its popu-larization.

The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiology of sports injuries in a single center. Methods: We interviewed 262 athletes from 10 different sports retrospectively about injuries sustained in their university careers and whose injuries sustained during one season were monitored prospectively. The characterization of the injuries included data on the location of the injury, type of injury, time of year, injury mechanism, and the moment of the injury during training or a game. Results: In the university history, the incidence of injuries was higher in men (81.5%) than in women (67.8%). Lower limb injuries were the most frequent both in the university history and the sea-son. The sports with the highest injury rate for the season was handball (34.2%) and for the university history was basketball (80.8%). The main injury mechanism was non-contact. The months with the highest incidence of injuries were those at the beginning of the season (53.3%). The most frequent diagnoses were ligament injuries, followed by fractures. Both the presence of a previous injury in the same region and the practice of weight training were predictive factors for injury. Conclusion: College athletes at this center are more likely to suffer injuries during the first months of the season, especially in contact sports involving lower limbs.

A total of 15 Polish Olympic 3×3 team players (age: 26.86 ± 8.28 years; body height: 191 ± 5.33 cm; body mass: 90.68 ± 10.03 kg, basketball experience: 15.53 ± 5.8 years) participated in the study. Athletes were tested for the following measures: the linear speed at the first section (5 m), the second section (9 m), the third section (10 m) and total distance (24 m), two sets; the 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test (first session); COD speed by the Change of Direction and Acceleration Test (CODAT) (the same sections and total distance as in the linear speed test), five repetitions, two sets; and jumping performance by the CMJ with and without an arm swing (second session). CODD was calculated by subtracting the COD speed time from linear speed time at adequate sections and total distance. Maximal sprinting speed (MSS), maximal aerobic velocity (VmaxIFT), and anaerobic speed reserve (ASR) were also considered. Anaerobic Speed Reserve (ASR) was calculated as the difference between MSS and VmaxIFT. A Pearson's correlation test was used to determine the relationship between power-speedrelated variables and CODD, final velocity attained at the 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test (VmaxIFT), ASR, and COD performance. Moderate to strong correlations were registered between COD and linear speed at 5, 10, and 24 m, while moderate to strong negative correlations were detected between COD, CODD, and CMJ, CMJa. Moreover, moderate to strong correlations were observed between COD, CODD, and VmaxIFT, MSS at 9, 10, and 24 m sprints. No relationship was detected between COD, CODD, LS, and ASR in any measured sector.

Thirty-one young male basketball players (13.18 years) volunteered to participate in this study. The sample was divided into 3 age groups (U-15, U-17, U-19). All the evaluations were carried out in the same order in 3 sessions as follows: 1) body composition, self-reported sexual maturation, COD performance, and intermittent endurance capacity 2) reactive strength index (RSI), 15-m sprint, and repeated sprint ability (RSA) test; 3) vertical and horizontal jumps and lower-limb strength. The results showed significant differences between groups for age, sexual maturation, endurance capacity, horizontal and vertical jump performances, RSI, COD, RSA, and lower-limb strength (p < 0.05). Significant correlations were identified between COD performances and some physical determinants such as jumping ability and RSA performance (-0.43 < r < 0.85; p . 0.05). In conclusion, there are age effects on COD performance and its specific physical determinants among young basketball male players. The associations between COD performance and its determinants should be considered by practitioners when programing athletic talent development for this population. © 2022 Editorial Committee of Journal of Human Kinetics.","adolescence; athletic talent; basketball; field testing; team sports","adolescence; adult; article; basketball; basketball player; body composition; controlled study; endurance; groups by age; human; jumping; lower limb; male; physician; sexual maturation; team sport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85145601812

Since those movements are seen as a key performance variable, COD assessments are included in performance diagnostics. However, some tests are criticized as they seem to be confounded by variables such as linear sprinting. Therefore, it is suggested that not only total COD time should be assessed, but also the athletes' COD movements should be examined more closely. For example, split times could be analyzed in tests with more than one COD like the Team-Sport-Specific COD (TSS-COD) test. We aimed to investigate the construct validity of the TSS-COD test, focusing on the homogeneity of the different test parts. We also tested how far sprint performance mapped onto COD performance. Test data were analyzed from 154 elite male and female volleyball and basketball athletes. A Fitlight © System was used to assess duration of the TSS-COD test. For the sprint tests, magnetic gates (Humotion GmbH) were used to measure sprint time. Explorative principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted including the test interval duration and the athletes' 5, 10, and 20 m sprint performance, to test the validity of the TSS-COD test. PCA results showed that the start interval formed a factor separate from the other COD sub-intervals. In addition, sprint performance was separated from all COD interval measures. The findings of the PCA were confirmed by split-half validation. Since sprint and COD performance represent independent performance domains within this analysis, we suggest the TSS-COD test to be a valid test to assess COD performance.","performance; principal component analysis; testing","adult; article; athlete; basketball; construct validity; female; human; male; principal component analysis; team sport; volleyball",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85145599596

Thirty-eight male basketball players (age: 15.47 ± 0.51 years; body height: 185.19 ± 5.67 cm; body mass: 71.87 ± 7.29 kg) completed countermovement jumps (CMJ) with and without an arm swing, squat jumps (SJs), linear sprints at 20 m with split times at 5 and 10 m, the pro-agility test and the zig-zag tests. Furthermore, the CODD was calculated as the difference between the 20 m linear speed result and CODs time in both COD tests. Pearson and Spearman analyses were used to determine the correlations between power-speed-related variables and the CODD. Moreover, independent t-tests and Cohen's d effect size (ES) were used to analyze the differences between the faster and slower players in the CODD. Moderate to strong significant negative correlations were observed between the CODD in the pro-agility test and linear speed at 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m (r = -0.55 to -0.46), while moderate negative significant correlation was found between the zig-zag CODD and SJs (r = -0.37) as well as small positive significant correlation between the CODD in the zig-zag test and the eccentric utilization ratio (EUR) (r = 0.23). Additionally, faster basketball players displayed significantly higher CODD values performing the pro-agility test.

Methods An online survey was sent to athletes, coaches and medical staff of the three best basketball leagues in Switzerland. The survey was subdivided in four sections: (1) characteristic of participants, (2) knowledge, opinions, attitudes and beliefs, (3) practices and (4) barriers and facilitators. Results Among 105 persons (n=45 female, n=60 male) who answered the survey, more than 60% (n=68) considered the risk of injury for basketball athletes as being high to very high. The ankle, knee and the hand were considered as being the most at risk. More than 80% of participants considered that recovery, training load and the warm-up quality were very important factors for IP. More than 90% of participants considered IP as either important or very important with 53 (50.5%) of the participants indicating using exercise-based IP in their clubs. Athletes and coaches' motivation and compliance were judged as either important or very important for successful IP implementation by more than 80% of participants, with the coach being reported as the most influential person. Environmental barriers towards human or infrastructural resources were also reported as factors influencing IP strategies, namely by female participants. Conclusion Good knowledge and positive attitude towards IP were reported by participants, but exercise-based IP strategies lack implementation. The coach was considered as the most influential person and was reported with the athletes as playing an important role towards successful implementation. © 2022 Author(s).

For this, a systematic review was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect, involving the use of keywords athletes, wheelchair basketball and test and performance. The search strategy carried out yielded a total of 270 results where, after eliminating duplicates and applying the previously established inclusion and exclusion criteria, 39 documents were included for detailed review based on qualitative synthesis. According to the collected literature, most tests included 20m sprint as a majority, followed by 5m sprint test and dynamometer, which indicates that the most evaluated physical qualities were speed, strength, agility, and anaerobic power. According to the aforementioned, it is concluded that the tests used are tools of easy access, for the most part, since large-scale sports implements are not necessary (excluding the Wingate test, which requires a crank ergometer).

Due to their physical peculiarities and sporting performance, these athletes require specific rehabilitation programs that are as fast, personalized and effective as possible. However, there are few studies specifically dedicated to these purposes. Surface electromyography (sEMG) seems a promising tool for better customization and achieving more targeted rehabilitation results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of sEMG to monitor SP rehabilitation outcomes in WB players. Thirty-three athletes were enrolled in this non-randomized clinical study and divided into two groups. Both groups underwent a shoulder rehabilitation protocol, but only the experimental group was monitored in real time with sEMG on the shoulders. At enrollment (T0), at the end of 4 weeks of the rehabilitation program (T1), and 8 weeks after T1 (T2), the following outcome measures were collected: Wheelchair User’s Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI), 20 m straight line test, shoulder abduction range of motion (ROM). There was a statistically significant difference for WUSPI and ROM scores in the comparison between groups (p < 0.001), and for all outcomes in the comparison between times and in the interaction between time and group (p < 0.001). Therefore, the experimental group showed a better improvement at all detection times compared to the control group. sEMG seems a useful tool for improving the monitoring of SP rehabilitation outcomes in WB players. This monitoring speeds up and improves the rehabilitative results, limiting the risk of sport abandonment and increasing the possibility for people with disabilities to quickly return to practice physical activity. © 2022 by the authors.","adaptive sports; basketball; biomechanics; disability; electromyography; outcome; Paralympics; rehabilitation; shoulder; sport; wheelchair","paracetamol; adult; analysis of variance; Article; athlete; basketball player; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; disability; Expanded Disability Status Scale; human; male; muscle contraction; muscle function; outcome assessment; pain assessment; patient abandonment; physiological stress; prospective study; range of motion; rehabilitation center; scoring system; shoulder pain; surface electromyography; wheelchair basketball; Wheelchair Users Shoulder Pain Index",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147477365

Our aim is to synthesise evidence related to assessing muscle strength in para-athletes. Four databases were searched from January 1990 to July 2021 for observational studies focusing on strength assessment. Independent screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed in duplicate. A total of 1764 potential studies were identified. Thirty met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The mean age of participants was 30.7 years (standard deviation [SD]: 2.4). The majority were men (88%) participating in wheelchair sports, including basketball, rugby, and tennis (23/30: 76%). Overall quality varied, with more than half of the studies failing to identify strategies for dealing with confounding variables. Despite manual muscle testing being a standard component of para-sport classification systems, evidence examining strength characteristics in para-athletes is derived primarily from isometric and isokinetic testing. In studies that included comparative strength data, findings were mixed. Some studies found strength values were similar to or lower than able-bodied athletic controls. However, an important observation was that others reported higher shoulder strength in para-athletes taking part in wheelchair sports than both able-bodied and disabled non-athletes. Studies need to develop accessible, standardised strength testing methods that account for training influence and establish normative strength values in para-athletes. There is also a need for additional studies that include female para-athletes and para-athletes with greater functional impairments. © 2022 Chengdu Sport University","Assessment; Disabled sport; Muscle strength; Para-athletes; Systematic review",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85145483820

The changes in electrolyte balance which occur during and after training affect on athletes health and performance. Therefore, fluid replacement with adequate mineral composition is of utmost importance. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of low mineral water from the well Sneznik-1/79 on anthropometric, functional, biochemical parameters and redox status of professional basketball players. In total, 17 male basketball players were included, during the pre-competitive mesocycle, and after the initial testing, they were randomly divided into two groups: group 1-consumed the commercial drinking water for four weeks (n=7), and group 2-consumed water from the well Sneznik-1/79 for four weeks (n=10). Determination of the anthropometric, functional, biochemical parameters and redox status was performed. Our results pointed out that consumption of mineral water from the well Sneznik is completely safe from the aspect of affecting various anthropometric, functional and biochemical parameters as well as systemic oxidative stress of professional athletes. In addition, existence of discretely better effects over commercial drinking water indicates that a long period of monitoring may certainly be of interest for further investigation. © 2022, University of Kragujevac, Faculty of Science.

Methods: multiple linear regression (MLR), quantile regression (QR), ridge regression (RR), support vector regression (SVR) with three different kernels, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and boosted regression trees (RTs) were compared to explain and predict VO2max and to choose the best performance model. The sample consisted of 4908 children (2314 males and 2594 females) aged between 6 and 17. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by the 20 m maximal multistage shuttle run test and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was calculated. Welch t-tests, Mann–Whitney-U tests, X2 tests, and ANOVA tests were performed. The performance measures were root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). All analyses were stratified by gender. Results: A comparison of the statistical indices for both the predicted and actual data indicated that in boys, the MLR model outperformed all other models in all indices, followed by the linear SVR model. In girls, the MLR model performed better than the other models in R2 but was outperformed by SVR-RBF in terms of RMSE and MAE. The overweight and obesity categories in both sexes (p &lt; 0.001) and maternal prepregnancy obesity in girls had a significant negative effect on VO2max. Age, weekly football training, track and field, basketball, and swimming had different positive effects based on gender. Conclusion: The MLR model showed remarkable performance against all other models and was competitive with the SVR models. In addition, this study’s data showed that changes in cardiorespiratory fitness were dependent, to a different extent based on gender, on BMI category, weight, height, age, and participation in some organized sports activities. Predictors that are not considered modifiable, such as gender, can be used to guide targeted interventions and policies. © 2022 by the authors.","adolescents; body mass Index (BMI) category; children; gender; machine learning; multiple linear regression; organized sports activity; VO2max",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85144708357

Misdiagnosed and untreated ankle sprains will cause chronic ankle instability (CAI), which can significantly affect the performance of athletes. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of CAI in elite athletes of different sports. Method: This cross-sectional study included 198 elite athletes from Guangdong provincial sports teams. All participants answered a questionnaire about ankle sprains and ankle instability. The severity of their ankle instability was evaluated by the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT). Participants further underwent clinical examinations from sports medicine doctors to determine the presence and characteristics of ankle instability. The datasets were analyzed to determine the differences in prevalence between age, gender, sports teams, and sports categories. Results: In 198 athletes, 39.4% (n = 78) had bilateral CAI while 25.3% (n = 50) had unilateral CAI. Female athletes had a higher prevalence of CAI than male athletes in the study (p = 0.01). Prevalence showed differences between sports categories, and were significantly higher in acrobatic athletes than non-contact athletes (p = 0.03). Conclusions: CAI was highly prevalent among elite athletes in this study, with female athletes and athletes in acrobatic sports being associated with a higher risk of developing CAI in their professional careers. Therefore, extra precautions need to be taken into account when applying ankle protections for these athletes. © 2022 by the authors.","ankle sprains; chronic ankle instability; elite athletes; prevalence; sports","adult; age; ankle instability; ankle sprain; Article; badminton; basketball; clinical assessment; clinical examination; cross-sectional study; diving; elite athlete; female; gymnastics; human; injury severity; major clinical study; male; medical history; non contact sport; positivity rate; prevalence; questionnaire; sport; track and field; weight lifting; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85144702821

Common scenarios for injury include wheeled recreational devices (WRDs) that allow children to be mobile and independent (example ATV-all terrain vehicles, dirt bikes, bicycles, skateboards, and scooters). We present a case series review of these external causes of injury. This study aims to evaluate epidemiologic trends in WRD injuries and patterns in usage of protective gear. Results: A total of 263 patients were identified as meeting criteria for inclusion with the following causes of injuries-103 bicycle, 73 ATV, 27 dirt bike, 14 skateboard, 13 motorcycle, 7 go carts, 3 hover board, 3 roller skates, 1 dune buggy, 1 motor scooter, 1 rip stick, and 1 tractor toy. Ages of patients ranged from 2 to 18 years of age with the greatest range being noted for bicycles (2–17 years) and motorcycles (3–18 years). The mean age was higher for motorcycle and skateboard (12.9 and 11.6, respectively) and lowest for scooter and bicycle (8.3 and 9.2, respectively). The majority of [overall study (97%) and for each mode of transportation] patients were Caucasian, which is in contrast to our overall ED population, which is only 42% Caucasian. The majority of patients were male [190 (72%)]. Over half of the overall patients, 159 of the 263 (60%), were not wearing a helmet (with only 10 charts having no documentation of helmet use). In regard to ATV riders specifically, 58% were not wearing helmets at the time of injury, with an additional 5 patients who reported their helmet came off. The lowest percentage of riders reporting appropriate helmet use was skateboarders with only 21% wearing helmets, and the highest percentage was dirt bike riders with 74% reporting helmet use. Conclusion: Common scenarios for injury include WRDs that allow children to be mobile and independent.

The first aim of this study was to investigate the association between the stiffness of the patellar and quadriceps tendon (PT, QT), gastrocnemius–Achilles tendon unit (GAT), and rectus femoris (RF) using drop jump (DJ) performance in young basketball players. The second aim was to investigate possible variations in the stiffness levels of those tissues in different developmental stages. Methods: The stiffness levels of the GAT, PT, QT, and RF were measured in both limbs in 73 male basketball players aged 12 to 18 years. The reactive strength index (RSI), contact time (CT) and jump height (JH) during 30 and 40 cm DJs were also measured. Results: Pearson correlation coefficients showed a significant association between DJ performance and PT, QT, GAT, and RF dynamic stiffness. Moreover, the youngest subjects were found to have lower stiffness values than the older ones. Conclusions: Tissue stiffness can affect athletic performance by modifying the stretch-shortening cycle in young basketball players. Stiffness of muscles and tendons increases during the maturation process. Further investigations could shed light on the effect of training on the stiffness of muscles and tendons. © 2022 by the authors.","biomechanics; drop jump; gastrocnemius-Achilles tendon unit; patellar tendon; quadriceps tendon; reactive strength index; rectus femoris; team sports","biomechanics; body condition; health status; movement; muscle; performance assessment; physical activity; sport; achilles tendon; adolescent; adult; Article; athletic performance; basketball player; biomechanics; child; contact time; controlled study; correlation coefficient; developmental stage; disease association; drop jump performance; gastrocnemius muscle; groups by age; human; human experiment; male; maturation; muscle rigidity; muscle stretching; musculoskeletal stiffness; musculoskeletal system examination; musculoskeletal system parameters; patellar ligament; physical performance; quadriceps tendon; reactive strength index; rectus femoris muscle; school child; team sport; tendon stiffness; achilles tendon; athletic performance; basketball; muscle strength; patellar ligament; physiology; skeletal muscle; Achilles Tendon; Athletic Performance; Basketball; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Patellar Ligament",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85144568313

Thirteen male basketball masters players (age: 66.6 ± 2.1 years; body mass: 89.9 ± 8.7 kg; stature: 183.7 ± 4.6 cm) were monitored during an official Lietuvos Krepsinio Veteranu Lyga (LKVL) 65-year game. Beside descriptive analysis, a chi-square goodness of fit test was adopted to assess the differences in the distribution within JUMP, ACC and COD classes of intensities (i.e., low, medium and high). The results revealed PL = 269.9 ± 83.3 AU and PL/min = 6.54 ± 1.29 AU/min. Moreover, significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) in the distribution of the intensity classes were found for JUMP, ACC, and COD, with the lowest intensities as the most frequent. Finally, HRpeak = 81.7 ± 8.1% and sRPE-load = 148.9 ± 69.7 AU were found, with sRPE = ~3 AU. In conclusion, a low external load during an official basketball game was found compared to other basketball populations. Moreover, a high objective internal load did not correspond to a low perceived demand, which might increase the training adherence and motivation during long-term studies. © 2022 by the authors.","basketball game; health; IMU; older adults; performance analysis; RPE",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85144508194

Fifty-nine basketball players, aged 14 to 19 years, and members of Bauru Basket team, were recruited for this study and grouped into control group (CG, n = 30) and intervention group (IG, n = 29). The participants were evaluated, before and after the intervention, by the following means: Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2), to measure the pre-competitive anxiety state, i.e., how anxious each athlete felt just before the competition; Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), an instrument for early detection of overtraining syndrome; Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (RESTQ-Sport), to identify the extent to which each athlete was physically or mentally stressed and the athlete’s current capability for recovery; Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), specifically developed for athletes. The IG athletes participated in 12 progressive muscle relaxation sessions, a practice for tensing or tightening a specific muscle until an ideal state of relaxation is reached. Each participant had blood pressure and heart rate measured before and after every session. The CG athletes were evaluated similarly to those in the IG but without relaxation. The results showed statistically significant differences in cognitive anxiety (p = 0.039) and specific stress (p = 0.016) between CG and IG before the intervention; in addition, a significant heart rate decrease (p < 0.01) between IG and CG was noted. © 2022 by the authors.","anxiety; athletes; blood pressure; heart hate; mood states; progressive muscle relaxation; stress","experimental study; mental health; muscle; physical activity; physiological response; psychology; questionnaire survey; sport; athlete; autogenic training; basketball; human; psychology; psychophysiology; questionnaire; Athletes; Autogenic Training; Basketball; Humans; Psychophysiology; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85144493745

However, they lack specificity and do not consider the player’s basketball skills. Several studies have suggested performing specific jump tests, which are tailored to the movement patterns and requirements of a basketball game. The pivot step jump test (PSJT) is a novel test designed to evaluate the specific jumping abilities of basketball players by combining a pivot step on one leg with a maximum bilateral vertical jump. This study had two aims: to determine the reliability and validity of the PSJT using typical jump tests as the criterion measure and to demonstrate the PSJT as a practical test to evaluate specific jumping ability in young male and female basketball players. Twenty female (EGA; 14.0 ± 0.7 years, 59.3 ± 7.9 kg, 162.1 ± 5.5 cm) and fifteen male (EGB; 14.0 ± 0.7 years, 58.1 ± 7.7 kg, 170.3 ± 6.4 cm) basketball players participated in the study. The test–retest reliability of the PSJT within sessions (intrasession reliability) and across sessions (intersession reliability) was assessed within EGA. For the evaluation of validity, EGB performed the PSJT and a series of criterion jumping tests. For EGA, no changes (p > 0.05) were found in PSJT performance between test sessions and excellent intra- and intersession reliability was observed (ICCs > 0.75). Correlation coefficients indicated high factorial validity between the jumping tests and PSJT (r = 0.71–0.91, p < 0.001). The PSJT appears to offer a valid assessment of jumping ability in basketball and is a practical test for assessing sport-specific jumping skills in young basketball players. © 2022 by the authors.","developmental age; interlimb asymmetry; motor skill assessment; performance; power; sport-specific skill; vertical jump",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85144493449

Thus, the purpose of the present study was twofold: (a) to examine the differences in the kinematic characteristics between free-throw, two-point, and three-point shots, and (b) to examine the differences between shooters with excellent (≥80%) and good (<80%) levels of shooting proficiency. A total of 10 professional male basketball players performed 5 free-throw (4.57 m), two-point (5.18 m), and three-point (6.75 m) shots, combining for a total of 150 shots. A high-definition camera recording at 120 fps was used to capture the shooting motion from a sagittal point of view, and video analysis software was used to analyze the kinematic variables of interest. The findings of the present study reveal that the kinematic characteristics during the preparatory phase of the shooting motion remain unchanged between free-throw and two-point shots. Three-point shots required lower elbow positioning, influenced by greater knee and hip flexion when compared to free-throw and two-point shots. The release angle was notably lower for shots attempted beyond the three-point line but remained unchanged between the free-throw and two-point shooting motions. Release height and vertical displacement were significantly greater for two- and three-point shots when compared to free-throw shots, while no difference was observed between the two- and three-point shots. In addition, no significant differences in shooting kinematics were observed between those participants with excellent and good levels of shooting proficiency. © 2022 by the authors.","biomechanics; coaching; free-throw; performance; sport; three-point; two-point",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85143787236

For this reason, the aim of this study was to search for relationships between psychological dimensions of femininity and masculinity and different forms of motivation, as well as their specific parts, among women and male athletes practicing team sports games. We researched 49 women aged 19 to 32 years representing sports such as football, handball, hockey, volleyball, and basketball and 56 men aged 18 to 31 years practicing football, hockey, volleyball, basketball, and handball. The respondents completed the Inventory to Assess Psychological Gender (IPP) and the Polish adaptation of the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS). It was determined that the psychological dimension of femininity was (in the male group) positively related to the dimension of amotivation, i.e., the lack of perception of a relationship between one’s action and the outcome. In turn, the psychological dimension of masculinity was positively related to the motivation to know, motivation to accomplish, and motivation to experience stimulation, as well as the overall level of intrinsic motivation and the overall dimension of extrinsic motivation. Furthermore, the masculinity dimension is, in male athletes, related to the level of the introjection motive, i.e., the process of integrating accepted patterns. © 2022 by the author.","femininity; masculinity; motivation; psychology; team sports","gender role; hypothesis testing; mental health; psychology; social behavior; sport; womens status; adult; article; athlete; basketball; controlled study; extrinsic motivation; female; femininity; football; hockey; human; human experiment; intrinsic motivation; major clinical study; male; masculinity; motivation; perception; psychology; team sport; volleyball; basketball; femininity; masculinity; motivation; soccer; Basketball; Female; Femininity; Humans; Male; Masculinity; Motivation; Soccer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85143713543

We sought to describe case characteristics, mitigation protocols used, variants detected, and secondary infections detected during the 2021 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men’s Basketball Tournament involving collegiate athletes from across the U.S. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data collected from March 16 to April 3, 2021, as part of a closed environment which required daily reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, social distancing, universal masking, and limited contact between tiers of participants. Nearly 3000 players, staff, and vendors participated in indoor, unmasked activities that involved direct exposure between cases and noninfected individuals. The main outcome of interest was transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus, as measured by the number of new infections and variant(s) detected among positive cases. Secondary infections were identified through contact tracing by public health officials. Results: Out of 2660 participants, 15 individuals (0.56%) screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. Four cases involved players or officials, and all cases were detected before any individual played in or officiated a game. Secondary transmissions all occurred outside the controlled environment. Among those disqualified from the tournament (4 cases; 26.7%), all individuals tested positive for the Iota variant (B.1.526). All other cases involved the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7). Nearly all teams (N = 58; 85.3%) reported that some individuals had received at least one dose of a vaccine. Overall, 17.9% of participants either had at least one dose of the vaccine or possessed documented infection within 90 days of the tournament.

Methods: Partial and complete quadriceps tendon tears in NBA players between the 1990-1991 and 2021-2022 seasons were queried from a publicly available database. The primary outcomes were changes in player performance statistics obtained from each player's preindex season and first 2 postindex seasons. These interseason changes were compared with the changes of a healthy control cohort. Each injured player was matched with 2 controls using position, career length and win shares by season. The secondary measure of this study was the rate of return to play. Results: Nine quadriceps tendon tears (6 partial, 3 complete) were identified in NBA players. Seven (78%) of the players returned to play in NBA games, missing 50 ± 30 games and 214 ± 112 calendar days on average. Comparisons between these player's preindex and first postindex seasons revealed significant declines in games played (73.2 ± 6.6 vs 41.8 ± 10.8, P = .009) and minutes per game (27.2 ± 2.9 vs 23.0 ± 3.7, P = .042). When compared with controls, only the decrease in games played was significant (–31.3 ± 7.6 vs 1.4 ± 8.2, P = .004). These findings were consistent when comparing preindex and second postindex seasons (games played: 79.6 ± 1.9 vs –28.4 ± 5.4, P = .006; minutes per game: 29.3 ± 2.6 vs 51.2 ± 4.6, P = .003). All other player performance metrics including player efficiency rating returned to near-baseline levels in the first 2 seasons after injury. Conclusion: NBA players with quadriceps tendon tears return to play in 78% of cases. These athletes achieved preinjury levels of performance within 1 to 2 seasons, but with reduced games played per season.

Methods: The PEARL study (2016–2018) randomized OOHCA patients without ST-elevation to early cardiac catheterization or not. Community consultation included flyers, radio announcements, newspaper advertisements, mailings, and in-person surveys at basketball games and ED waiting rooms. The PROTECT trial (2021-present) randomizes OOHCA survivors to prophylactic ceftriaxone or placebo; the community consultation plan during the pandemic included city council presentations, social media posts, outpatient flyers, but no in-person encounters. Demographics for PROTECT community consultation were compared to PEARL and INTCAR registry data, with p-value < 0.05 considered significant. Results: PEARL surveyed 1,362 adults, including 64 % ≥60 years old, 96 % high school graduates or beyond; research acceptance rate was 92 % for the community and 76 % for personal level. PROTECT initially obtained 221 surveys from electronic media – including fewer males (28 % vs 72 %,p < 0.001) and those > 60 years old (14 % vs 53 %;p < 0.001) compared to INTCAR. These differences prompted a revised community consultation plan, targeting 79 adult in-patients with cardiac disease which better matched PEARL and INTCAR data: the majority were ≥ 60 years old (66 %) and male (54 %). Both PEARL and PROTECT enrolled more patients using surrogate consent vs EFIC (57 %, 61 %), including 71 % as remote electronic consents during PROTECT. Conclusions: Community consultation for EFIC studies changed with the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in different demographic patterns. We describe effective adaptations to community consultation and surrogate consent during the pandemic. © 2022 The Author(s)","Cardiac arrest; Community Consultation; Ethics; Exception From Informed Consent (EFIC); Research ethics; Research in emergency settings",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140962878

Methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent subpectoral mini-open biceps tenodesis following failed SLAP repair between January 2011 and October 2019 was performed. Inclusion criteria included age older than 16 years, skeletal maturity, and a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Both athletes and nonathletes were included across all types of sport. Patients who had anterior or posterior instability or rotator cuff tears were excluded; in addition, those requiring concomitant procedures were excluded. Case–control matching was performed using age, sex, indication, follow-up, and type of sport, to generate a 3:1 control group for the primary biceps tenodesis cohort. Primary outcome measurements were collected via telephone in 2020 and included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, visual analog scale score, Subjective Shoulder Value score, patient satisfaction, willingness to undergo surgery again, and revisions. RTP and timing of RTP were evaluated as secondary outcomes. A P value of <.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: The current study included 76 patients in total; 57 patients with primary biceps tenodesis, and 19 patients with secondary biceps tenodesis. The mean age was 39 years (19-48 years), 100% were male, and the mean follow-up was 54 months (16-99 months). Patient reported outcomes were obtained postoperatively via telephone survey. Overall, we found that primary biceps tenodesis patients reported greater American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (89.9 vs 76.4, P = .0162), lower visual analog scale scores (1.0 vs 3.1, P = .0034), and greater Subjective Shoulder Value scores (86.7 vs 64.7, P = .0004). Overall, there was no significant difference in the total rate of RTP (84% vs 75%, P = .5025), or timing of RTP (8.2 months vs 8.1 months, P = .9529) between patient groups. Patients reported playing tennis, swimming, golf, rock climbing, and basketball. No patients required a further shoulder surgery after undergoing biceps tenodesis. Conclusions: In this study, patients undergoing primary biceps tenodesis had significantly better functional outcomes compared with secondary biceps tenodesis following a failed SLAP repair.

Advantages in pairing BFR with training can be observed in two scenarios: (1) training at lower absolute intensities (e.g. walking) elicits adaptations akin to high-intensity sessions (e.g. running intervals); (2) when performing exercise at moderate to high intensities, higher physiological stimulus may be attained, leading to larger improvements in aerobic, anaerobic, and muscular parameters. The former has been well documented in recent systematic reviews, but consensus on BFR (concomitant or post-exercise) combined with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols is not well established. Therefore, this systematic review evaluates the acute and chronic effects of BFR + HIIT. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to identify relevant studies. A systematic search on 1 February 2022, was conducted on four key databases: ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus and SPORTDiscus. Quality of each individual study was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Extraction of data from included studies was conducted using an adapted version of the 'Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome' (PICO) framework. Results: A total of 208 articles were identified, 18 of which met inclusion criteria. Of the 18 BFR + HIIT studies (244 subjects), 1 reported both acute and chronic effects, 5 examined acute responses and 12 investigated chronic effects. Acutely, BFR challenges the metabolic processes (vascular and oxygenation responses) during high-intensity repeated sprint exercise—which accelerates central and peripheral neuromuscular fatigue mechanisms resulting in performance impairments. Analysis of the literature exploring the chronic effects of BFR + HIIT suggests that BFR does provide an additive physiological training stimulus to HIIT protocols, especially for measured aerobic, muscular, and, to some extent, anaerobic parameters. Conclusion: Presently, it appears that the addition of BFR into HIIT enhances physiological improvements in aerobic, muscular, and, to some extent, anaerobic performance. However due to large variability in permutations of BFR + HIIT methodologies, it is necessary for future research to explore and recommend standardised BFR guidelines for each HIIT exercise type. © 2022, The Author(s).","Aerobic exercise; Blood flow restriction; Endurance; Interval training; Occlusion; Sprint","oxyhemoglobin; testosterone; vasculotropin; aerobic capacity; aerobic exercise; angiogenesis; basketball player; blood flow restriction training; capillary density; electromyography; endurance; endurance training; exercise intensity; heart rate; human; hypoxia; interval training; mean arterial pressure; meta analysis (topic); mitochondrial biogenesis; muscle mass; muscle strength; muscle thickness; occlusion; oxygen saturation; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; Review; stretching exercise; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; treadmill exercise; walking",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139242066

Methods: This prospective cohort pilot study had a sample size target of 50 volunteers between 12 and 14 years old at sites in Canada, South Korea, and the Netherlands. Participants were evaluated clinically and radiographically at baseline and at 2 years. The participants’ sport and physical activity were evaluated using the Habitual Activity Estimation Scale (HAES) and the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) criteria for sport specialization. The primary outcome was feasibility and secondary outcomes included the incidence of radiographic FAI and hip range of motion, function (Hip Outcome Score, HOS), and quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire, PedsQL) at 24 months. Study groups were defined at the completion of follow-up, given the changes in participant activity levels over time. Results: Of the 54 participants enrolled, there were 36 (33% female) included in the final analysis. At baseline, those classified as highly active and played at least one organized sport had a higher incidence of asymptomatic radiographic FAI markers (from 6/32, 18.8% at baseline to 19/32, 59.4% at 24 months) compared to those classified as low activity (1/4, 25% maintained at baseline and 24 months). The incidence of radiographic FAI markers was higher among sport specialists (12/19, 63.2%) compared to non-sport specialists (8/17, 47.1%) at 24 months. The HOS and PedsQL scores were slightly higher (better) among those that were highly active and played a sport compared to those who did not at 2 years (mean difference (95% confidence interval): HOS-ADL subscale 4.56 (− 7.57, 16.70); HOS-Sport subscale 5.97 (− 6.91, 18.84); PedsQL Physical Function 7.42 (− 0.79, 15.64); PedsQL Psychosocial Health Summary 6.51 (− 5.75, 18.77)). Conclusion: Our pilot study demonstrated some feasibility for a larger scale, definitive cohort study. The preliminary descriptive data suggest that adolescents engaged in higher levels of activity in sports may have a higher risk of developing asymptomatic hip deformities related to FAI but also better quality of life over the 2-year study period. © 2022, The Author(s).","Adolescents; Femoroacetabular impingement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Sports specialization","adolescent; American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine; archery; Article; assessment of humans; basketball; Canada; child; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; cycling; emotional stability; equestrian; feasibility study; female; femoroacetabular impingement; follow up; football; frisbee; gymnastics; Habitual Activity Estimation Scale; high intensity exercise; hiking (sport); hip malformation; hockey; human; incidence; lacrosse (sport); major clinical study; male; Netherlands; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; physical performance; pilot study; prospective study; quality of life; racquet sport; range of motion; running; sample size; school; skiing; soccer; social interaction; social well-being; South Korea; sport; swimming; volleyball; weight lifting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138108479

Objective: To collate existing literature investigating external and internal load variables during training and games in female basketball players according to playing level (club, high-school, representative, collegiate, semi-professional, and professional) and playing position (backcourt and frontcourt players). Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science to identify studies published from database inception until June 11, 2021. Studies eligible for inclusion were observational and cross-sectional studies, published in English, reporting external and/or internal load variables during training sessions and/or games. Methodological quality and bias were assessed for each study prior to data extraction using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Weighted means according to playing level and playing position were calculated and compared if a load variable was reported across two or more player samples and were consistent regarding key methodological procedures including the seasonal phase monitored, minimum exposure time set for including player data (playing time during games), approach to measure session duration, and approach to measure session intensity. Results: The search yielded 5513 studies of which 1541 studies were duplicates. A further 3929 studies were excluded based on title and abstract review, with 11 more studies excluded based on full-text review. Consequently, 32 studies were included in our review. Due to the wide array of methodological approaches utilized across studies for examined variables, comparisons could only be made according to playing level for blood lactate concentration during games, revealing backcourt players experienced higher lactate responses than frontcourt players (5.2 ± 1.9 mmol·L−1 vs. 4.4 ± 1.8 mmol·L−1). Conclusions: Inconsistencies in the methods utilized to measure common load variables across studies limited our ability to report and compare typical external and internal loads during training and games according to playing level and position in female basketball players. It is essential that standardized methodological approaches are established for including player data as well as measuring session duration (e.g., total time, live time) and intensity (e.g., consistent rating of perceived exertion scales, intensity zone cut points) in future female basketball research to permit meaningful interpretation and comparisons of load monitoring data across studies. © 2022, The Author(s).","Demands; Heart rate; Methodological quality; Microsensor; Monitoring; RPE; Video analysis; Women","lactic acid; athlete; basketball player; body mass; checklist; cross-sectional study; data extraction; exercise; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; lactate blood level; Medline; normal human; physical activity; quality control; Review; systematic review; videorecording; Web of Science",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136975620

The objective of this study was to assess the contributions of 8-week combined versus single-mode training programs based on drop jump (DJ) and specific multidirectional repeated sprint (MRSA) on repeated sprint ability performances, body balance and lower limbs power in male professional basketball players. Methods: This study followed a randomized parallel study design. Fifty-two professional male basketball players from the Tunisian first division participated in this study. The players were randomly assigned to 4 groups: DJ group (JG; n = 13), MRSA group (RSG; n = 13), combined group (COMB; n = 13) and an active control group (CON; n = 13). The JG, RSG and COMB groups completed the 8-week training programs with 2 sessions per week while the CON continues their regular basketball training. Training volume was similar between groups all over the experimental period. Before and after the intervention, the four groups were evaluated for the stork test, Y-balance test, the repeated sprint ability test (IRSA5COD), the squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ) tests, the single leg drop jump test, the five time-jump test and T—change of direction (CoD) test. Results: All measures displayed significant main effect, (medium/small) magnitude (effect size) improvements for time (post-test &gt; pre-test) except the physiological parameters for IRSA5COD. Significant time × group interactions were revealed for body balance, T test, IRSA5COD (total time and best time) and jump tests (vertical/horizontal). Bonferroni corrected post-hoc tests revealed significant greater improvement in favor of RSG and COMB compared to JG for body balance, CoD and IRSA5COD. Moreover, greater improvement in CMJ, SJ and single leg DJ in favor of JG compared to the RSG. In addition, a greater CoD improvement was observed in favor of COMB when compared to the RSG. Conclusion: Combined and single-mode training programs based on DJ and MRSA contributed to a significantly better performance in specific basketball physical fitness parameters with results favoring combined interventions. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agility; Athletic performance; Fatigue; Muscle strength; Physical fitness; Stability; Team sports","adult; Article; athletic performance; athletic rehabilitation; basketball; basketball player; body equilibrium; change of direction test; clinical article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; countermovement jump test; exercise; fitness; five time jump test; group dynamics; human; intermethod comparison; intervention study; jumping; kinesiotherapy; lower limb; male; motor function test; motor performance; multidirectional repeated sprint; parallel design; physiological adaptation; plyometrics; post hoc analysis; pretest posttest control group design; professional athlete; randomized controlled trial; repeated sprint ability test; single leg drop jump test; squat jump test; stork test; task performance; training; Tunisian; y balance test",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136547471

It is played in tournament form with multiple games per day. Therefore, optimal regeneration is crucial for maintaining a high performance level over the course of the tournament. To elucidate how load of a match affects the athletes' bodies (i.e., internal load), muscular responses to the load of 3 × 3 games were analyzed. We aimed to investigate changes in contractility of the m. rectus femoris (RF) and m. gastrocnemius medialis (GC) in response to the load of single 3 × 3 games and a 3 × 3 tournament. Methods: Inertial movement analysis was conducted to capture game load in 3 × 3. Changes in contractility were measured using tensiomyography (TMG). During a two-day tournament, TMG measurements were conducted in the morning and after each game. Additionally, off-game performance analysis consisting of jump and change-of-direction (COD) tests was conducted the day before the tournament. Results: Significant changes of the muscle contractility were found for GC with TMG values being higher in the baseline than in the post-game measurements. In contrast to athletes of the GC group, athletes of the RF group responded with either decreased or increased muscle contractility after a single 3 × 3 game. A significant correlation between external and internal load parameters could not be shown. Concerning off-game performance, significant correlations can be reported for COD test duration, CMJ height and ∆Vc as well as COD test duration and ∆Dm. No systematic changes in muscle contractility were found over the course of the tournament in RF and GC. Conclusion: The athletes' external 3 × 3 game load and their performance level did not seem to affect muscular contractility after a single 3 × 3 game or a complete 3 × 3 tournament within this investigation. This might indicate that elite athletes can resist external load without relevant local muscular fatigue. With respect to the course of the tournament, it can therefore be concluded that the breaks between games seem to be sufficient to return to the initial level of muscle contractility. © 2022, The Author(s).","External load; Internal load; LPS; Team sport; Time-motion analysis; TMG","acceleration; adult; Article; ball sports athlete; basketball; competition game; controlled study; human; jumping; male; movement (physiology); muscle contractility; muscle fatigue; normal human; performance; tensiomyography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135256554

Moreover, para-sport athletes are subjected to a dual load on their upper extremities from competition and daily life, making it even more critical to maintain upper extremity health. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of joint disorders in elite wheelchair basketball players using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: We scanned MRI images of the bilateral shoulders, elbows, and wrist joints of ten elite wheelchair basketball players and ten general wheelchair users. The elite wheelchair players were athletes who underwent at our institution medical checkup of the candidates for the national team for the international women's tournament and who agreed to this research purpose. The general wheelchair players were recruited from wheelchair users in their 20s and 30s who had no daily exercise habits and who agreed to the study objectives. Two radiologists interpreted the MRI images and diagnosed the diseases of each joint. We compared the number of lesions between the two groups. We used Fisher's exact test to determine whether the lesions diagnosed by MRI were specific to wheelchair basketball players. The significance threshold was set at P < 0.05. Results: Elite wheelchair basketball players had significantly more right-sided, left-sided and bilateral latero-posterior lesions, which are cysts found on the lateral-posterior corner of the capitulum of the humerus than did general wheelchair users (P < 0.05). Severe damage to the right triangular fibrocartilage complex was also observed more frequently (P < 0.05) in wheelchair basketball players. Conclusions: We believe that the patients’ tendency to fall forward in the wheelchair hitting both hands on the ground, thereby injuring the triangular fibrocartilage complex and locking the lateral elbow, may be the cause of the characteristic findings on MRI. High-speed wheelchair operation was also considered a cause of severe triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries. This study's insights can be useful for future solutions to extend players' careers. © 2022, The Author(s).","Joint of upper extremity; Magentic resonance imaging; Triangular fibrocartilage complex injury; Wheelchair basketball player","adult; arthropathy; Article; controlled study; elbow injury; elite athlete; exercise; female; human; humeral condyle; informed consent; interrater reliability; musculoskeletal radiologist; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; rotator cuff; rotator cuff rupture; shoulder; shoulder injury; triangular fibrocartilage; wheelchair basketball; wrist; wrist injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135096657

Reconstruction of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament in the anatomical position using autologous tendons is a recent surgical trend. This study is to report clinical and radiologic results of reconstruction of the CC ligament using an autologous palmaris longus tendon interweaved with Mersilene tape (PLMT) with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 76 patients (mean age, 43.4 ± 11.2 years) with AC joint dislocation treated by reconstruction of the CC ligament with PLMT, from March 2004 to February 2017. The mean follow-up period was 28 ± 6.7 months (range, 24–66 months). The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain assessment, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons rating scale (ASES), and Constant Score (CS) were used to evaluate clinical outcomes at the preoperative and the final follow-ups. CC and AC distances were measured using anteroposterior (AP) X-ray preoperatively and at the final follow-up for radiologic outcomes. Complications were also assessed. Results: The mean preoperative VAS for pain, ASES, CS were 5.7 ± 0.7, 77.1 ± 6.2, and 61.5 ± 5.2, respectively. These scores at the final follow-up improved to 2.1 ± 0.5, 90.9 ± 4.3, and 94 ± 7.0, respectively (p = 0.043, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). The mean preoperative CC and AC distances were 16.49 ± 3.73 mm and 13.84 ± 3.98 mm, respectively. The final follow-up CC and AC distances were 9.29 ± 2.72 mm and 5.30 ± 2.09 mm, respectively (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). Although a slight re-widening of the CC distance occurred in 10 patients (13.1%), most patients regained full range of motion of the affected shoulder at the final follow-up. Conclusion: The CC ligament reconstruction with PLMT for the treatment of AC joint dislocation showed good clinical and radiological results. This technique could be a good alternative treatment for AC dislocations. © 2022, The Author(s).","Acromioclavicular joint; Coracoclavicular ligament; Dislocation; Mersilene tape; Palmaris longus; Shoulder injury","antibiotic agent; polyethylene terephthalate; acromioclavicular dislocation; adolescent; adult; aged; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score; Article; basketball; bone erosion; clavicle fracture; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; Constant Murley (score); controlled study; coracoclavicular joint; cycling; device migration; device safety; disease classification; disease severity; falling; female; heterotopic ossification; human; human tissue; image analysis; implant infection; major clinical study; male; martial art; open reduction (procedure); palmaris longus muscle; plate fixation; range of motion; retrospective study; return to sport; return to work; shoulder radiography; shoulder surgery; soccer; sport injury; stretching exercise; traffic accident; treatment duration; visual analog scale; diagnostic imaging; joint dislocation; joint ligament; middle aged; shoulder dislocation; tendon; Adult; Humans; Joint Dislocations; Ligaments, Articular; Middle Aged; Polyethylene Terephthalates; Retrospective Studies; Shoulder Dislocation; Tendons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133544886

However, the term “movement variability” can mean different things depending on context, and when used by itself does not capture the specifics of what has been investigated. Within sport, complex movements are performed repeatedly under a variety of different constraints (e.g. different situations, presence of defenders, time pressure). Movement variability has implications for sport performance and injury risk management. Given the importance of movement variability, it is important to understand the terms used to measure and describe it. This broad term of “movement variability” does not specify the different types of movement variability that are currently being assessed in the sporting literature. We conducted a scoping review (1) to assess the current terms and definitions used to describe movement variability within sporting tasks and (2) to utilise the results of the review for a proposed framework that distinguishes and defines the different types of movement variability within sporting tasks. To be considered eligible, sources must have assessed a sporting movement or skill and had at least one quantifiable measure of movement variability. A total of 43 peer-reviewed journal article sources were included in the scoping review. A total of 280 terms relating to movement variability terminology were extracted using a data-charting form jointly developed by two reviewers. One source out of 43 (2%) supplied definitions for all types of movement variability discussed. Moreover, 169 of 280 terms (60%) were undefined in the source material. Our proposed theoretical framework explains three types of movement variability: strategic, execution, and outcome. Strategic variability describes the different approaches or methods of movement used to complete a task. Execution variability describes the intentional and unintentional adjustments of the body between repetitions within the same strategy. Outcome variability describes the differences in the result or product of a movement. These types emerged from broader frameworks in motor control and were adapted to fit the movement variability needs in sports literature. By providing specific terms with explicit definitions, our proposed framework can ensure like-to-like comparisons of previous terms used in the literature. The practical goal of this framework is to aid athletes, coaches, and support staff to gain a better understanding of how the different types of movement variability within sporting tasks contribute to performance. The framework may allow training methods to be tailored to optimise the specific aspects of movement variability that contribute to success.

The aim of study was to investigate the effect of bilateral symmetry of vertical time to stabilization (vTTS) in postural sway after double-leg landing (DLL) in elite athletes with unilateral CAI. Methods: Twenty professional players with unilateral CAI and ten healthy controls were assigned to three groups (soccer, basketball, and control groups, n = 10 each). The postural balance during DLL tasks was assessed based on center of pressure (CoP) and vTTS. Multiple analysis of variance was conducted to statistically analyse the CoP and vTTS which followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test (P < 0.05). Results: The vTTS of the injured foot was significantly longer in the soccer and basketball players than in the control players (P = 0.006, p < 0.001 respectively). The intragroup comparison showed a significant difference in the vTTS of CAI and uninjured feet among the basketball players (mean difference = 1.3 s). The basketball group exhibited a worse balance in CoP oscillations results between groups. Conclusions: The findings suggested that symmetry between double-leg vTTS values, may be important as much as the sooner vTTS in reduced CoP oscillations and enhanced balance after DLL. Balancing exercises should achieve sooner vTTS in soccer players and symmetry in the double-leg vTTS of basketball players with unilateral CAI while maintaining static balance during dynamic-to-static postural changes to reduce recurrent ankle sprain. © 2022, The Author(s).","Basketball; Injury prevention; Postural control; Soccer; Stability","ankle injury; athlete; basketball; complication; human; joint instability; leg; soccer; Ankle Injuries; Athletes; Basketball; Humans; Joint Instability; Leg; Soccer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130913016

However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating iron levels in athletes during training periods with low training loads. In the current study, we analyzed the effect of an acute exercise on early responses of iron and iron regulatory proteins at the end of such training periods. Methods: The study was performed at the end of competitive phase of training. A total of 27 trained female basketball players were included in the study after application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The participants performed an incremental exercise on a treadmill. Blood samples were taken before the test, immediately after exercise, and after 3 h of restitution. Parameters, such as interleukin (IL) 6, hepcidin, ferritin, transferrin, hemopexin, and lactoferrin levels, total iron-biding capacity (TIBC), unsaturated iron-biding capacity (UIBC) were determined by using appropriate biochemical tests. Results: The level of iron increased significantly after exercise, and then decreased within next 3 h restitution. Except for iron levels, only TIBC levels significantly increased after exercise and decreased to baseline level during rest period. No significant changes in the levels of hepcidin, IL-6, and other proteins related to the iron homeostasis were observed. Conclusions: The increases in iron level after acute exercise is short-term and transient and appear to have been insufficient to induce the acute systemic effects in rested athletes. © 2022, The Author(s).","Acute exercise; Female athletes; Ferritin; Hepcidin; IL-6; Iron homeostasis; Transferrin","ferritin; hemopexin; hepcidin; interleukin 6; iron; iron regulatory factor; lactoferrin; myoglobin; transferrin; adolescent; Article; basketball player; blood sampling; female; ferritin blood level; human; human experiment; iron binding capacity; iron blood level; iron chelation; iron homeostasis; iron metabolism; normal human; parameters; protein expression; transferrin saturation; treadmill exercise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128365882

It is therefore important to better understand the needs and preferences of park features among adults to help park designers to create parks that optimise use. This qualitative study provided an in-depth examination of factors and characteristics that influence visitation, park-based physical activity, and social interaction among adults (19–64 years). We also explored perceptions of parks and park use and impacts of COVID on park usage and needs. Methods: Participants (n = 27, 40.4 years [+ 11.9], 70% female) were interviewed from 2017 to 2020 while walking through one of eight diverse parks located in varying socioeconomic areas of metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Participants were prompted to discuss their experiences, opinions and preferences regarding park features. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo 12 software. Results: Park features and characteristics highly valued for visitation related to aesthetics and atmosphere, including trees, gardens, spaciousness, and water features. Features most valued for physical activity included walking and bike tracks, basketball rings, nice aesthetics, and sports walls. Features most valued for social interaction included seating and tables, and picnic/barbecue areas. Conclusions: This study highlights features and characteristics that may be important to prioritise, to encourage active and social park visits among adults. This evidence will help policy and decision makers, urban planners, landscape architects, and local, state, and national government organisations to create parks that support adults to lead healthy and active lives. Future research should examine the relative importance of the features identified in this study to inform future park design/redesign. © 2022, The Author(s).","Adults; Design; Park features; Physical activity; Social interaction","adult; demography; environmental planning; female; human; male; recreation; recreational park; walking; Adult; COVID-19; Environment Design; Female; Humans; Male; Parks, Recreational; Recreation; Residence Characteristics; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128316017

However, biomechanics of DVJ may differ with various sporting activities. The purpose of the present study was to clarify whether biomechanical features of DVJ are different among various sporting activities in female athletes. Methods: A total of 42 female athletes, including 25 basketball, 8 soccer and 9 volleyball players, participated in the current investigation. DVJ was done for each female athlete using a three-dimensional motion analysis system which consisted of six cameras, two force plates and 46 retro-reflective markers. Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded for both limbs in each athlete. Simultaneously, frontal and sagittal plane views of the DVJ were recorded using two different high-resolution video cameras to evaluate Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) score. Three-dimensional biomechanical parameters at the knee joint and LESS were compared among three different sporting activities using ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test after confirming normality assumption. Thereafter post hoc Tukey or Steel–Dwass was utilized for multiple comparison. Results: Soccer players had better LESS score, and peak knee flexion angle was significantly larger in soccer players compared to the other sports. In addition, knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC), peak knee abduction angle, knee internal rotation angle, and knee abduction moment within 40 ms from IC were significantly smaller in soccer players, compared to basketball players. In terms of volleyball players, knee abduction angle at IC and knee internal rotation angle at IC were significantly larger than soccer players, whereas no significant biomechanical differences were found between basketball and volleyball players. Conclusions: From the present study, female basketball and volleyball players have worse LESS score, smaller peak knee flexion angle, greater knee abduction angle at IC and greater knee internal rotation angle at IC, compared to female soccer players. Thus, female basketball and volleyball players may have an increased risk of non-contact ACL injury during the jump-landing task, compared to soccer players. Biomechanics of DVJ depends on characteristics of the athlete's primary sport. © 2022, The Author(s).","Anterior cruciate ligament; Biomechanics; Drop vertical jump; Female athletes; Sport-specific movement","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; athlete; basketball player; biomechanics; drop vertical jump; female; ground reaction force; human; human experiment; jumping; kinematics; knee abduction angle; knee abduction moment; knee angle; knee flexion angle; knee internal rotation angle; Kruskal Wallis test; landing error scoring system; physical parameters; post hoc analysis; range of motion; scoring system; soccer player; volleyball; athlete; basketball; biomechanics; injury; knee; soccer; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Athletes; Basketball; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Knee; Knee Joint; Soccer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127896321

Methods: A systematic literature research was conducted using five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Scopus). BF values were extracted, with analyses conducted using random-effects models and data reported as percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: After screening, 80 articles representing 4335 basketball players were selected. Pooled mean BF was 13.1% (95% CI 12.4–13.8%) for male players and 20.7% (95% CI 19.9–21.5%) for female players. Pooled mean BF was 21.4% (95% CI 18.4–24.3%) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 15.2% (95% CI 12.8–17.6%) via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), 12.4% (95% CI 10.6–14.2%) via skinfolds and 20.0% (95% CI 13.4–26.6%) via air displacement plethysmography. Pooled mean BF across competitive levels were 13.5% (95% CI 11.6–15.3%) for international, 15.7% (95% CI 14.2–17.2%) for national and 15.1% (95% CI 13.5–16.7%) for regional-level players. As the meta-regression revealed significant effects of sex, measurement method and competitive level on BF, the meta-analysis was adjusted for these moderators. The final model revealed significant differences in BF between male and female players (p < 0.001). BF measured by DXA was significantly higher than that measured by BIA or skinfolds (p < 0.001). International-level players had significantly lower BF than national and regional-level players (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite the limitations of published data, this meta-analysis provides reference values for BF of basketball players. Sex, measurement method and competitive level influence BF values, and therefore must be taken into account when interpreting results. © 2022, The Author(s).","Anthropometry; Fat mass; Physique assessment; Playing level; Reference values; Skinfolds; Team sports","adult; anthropometry; basketball player; body fat; Cinahl; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat mass; female; human; impedance; male; Medline; meta analysis; plethysmography; reference value; review; Scopus; skinfold; systematic review; team sport; Web of Science",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125464854

Chronic ankle instability develops from an acute ankle sprain may cause negative effects on quality of life, ankle functionality or on increasing risk for recurrent ankle sprains and post-traumatic osteoarthritis. To facilitate a preventative strategy of chronic ankle instability (CAI) in the basketball population, gathering epidemiological data is essential. However, the epidemiological data of CAI in basketball is limited. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the prevalence of CAI in basketball athletes and to determine whether gender, competitive level, and basketball playing position influence this prevalence. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, in total 391 Taiwanese basketball athletes from universities and sports clubs participated. Besides non-standardized questions about demographics and their history of ankle sprains, participants further filled out the standard Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool applied to determine the presence of ankle instability. Questionnaires from 255 collegiate and 133 semi-professional basketball athletes (male = 243, female = 145, 22.3 ± 3.8 years, 23.3 ± 2.2 kg/m2) were analyzed. Differences in prevalence between gender, competitive level and playing position were determined using the Chi-square test. Results: In the surveyed cohort, 26% had unilateral CAI while 50% of them had bilateral CAI. Women had a higher prevalence than men in the whole surveyed cohort (X2(1) = 0.515, p = 0.003). This gender disparity also showed from sub-analyses, that the collegiate female athletes had a higher prevalence than collegiate men athletes (X2(1) = 0.203, p = 0.001). Prevalence showed no difference between competitive levels (p &gt; 0.05) and among playing positions (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: CAI is highly prevalent in the basketball population. Gender affects the prevalence of CAI. Regardless of the competitive level and playing position the prevalence of CAI is similar. The characteristic of basketball contributes to the high prevalence. Prevention of CAI should be a focus in basketball. When applying the CAI prevention measures, gender should be taken into consideration. © 2022, The Author(s).","Ankle injury; Ankle sprain; Basketball; Functional ankle instability; Perceived ankle instability; Survey","adult; ankle injury; ankle instability; ankle sprain; Article; basketball; body mass; chi square test; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demographics; female; gender inequality; health survey; human; informed consent; major clinical study; male; prevalence; questionnaire; sex difference; statistics; test retest reliability; university; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125353027

Methods: The sample included 904 female Polish players (U13–15). In part 1, maturity timing category distribution were examined within across age-groups. Maturity timing was followed by grouping with respect to years before or after the observed peak high velocity (PHV): PHV0 (− 0.50 to 0.49), PHV1 (0.50 to 1.49), PHV2 (1.50 to 2.49) and PHV3 (2.50 to 3.49). In part 2, the relationship between the anthropometric variables, physical fitness performance was assessed based on maturity timing categories (ANCOVA analysis). In part 3, backward stepwise multiple regression analyse quantified the relationship between maturity timing (group of PHV) and physical performance. Results: ANCOVA results (age, body height, and body mass as covariates) showed in the U13 female basketball players significantly higher sprinting (20 m), jumping ability and endurance tests results of the PHV1 group. Better results was observed in U14 female players in PHV1 compared to PHV2 and PHV3 in 20 m and jumping tests but opposite trend was observed for 5 m sprint and endurance test (distance covered and VO2max). U15 basketball players from the PHV3 group were characterized by better results of jumping abilities, endurance, 10 m and 20 m sprint and agility (total, S4) tests. Maturity timing (10 m), chronological age (5 m, 20 m, agility, SVJ, VJ, and VO2max tests), body height (10 m), body mass (10 m, 20 m, VJ, VO2max), and the interaction between body mass and height (SVJ) were significant (adjusted R2 = 0.02–0.10; p &lt; 0.001) predictors of motor skills. Conclusion: Trainng content of female basketball players aged 13–15 years old should be adjusted to biological requirements especially in jumping, endurance and 20 m sprint test.

To investigate the influence of sports experience on the distribution, we examined distribution of the pro-saccade reaction time under overlap and gap conditions, for the basketball club, table tennis club, and non-sporting control groups. Methods: Subjects performed pro-saccade tasks under the overlap and gap conditions, in which the intentional and reflexive disengagement of fixation are important, respectively. Under the overlap condition, the central fixation point was illuminated for a random duration of 1–3 s, then the fixation point was turned off. Just after the switch-off of the fixation point, one of the peripheral targets was illuminated for a duration of 1 s. The visual stimulus under the gap condition was almost the same as that under the overlap condition. However, only the temporal gap between the switch-off of the fixation point and the onset of the target differed between those conditions. The gap duration in the gap condition was set at 200 ms. The mean of median value of the bandwidth showing the earliest peak in the histogram was calculated for each group. Thereafter, for each subject, the bandwidth showing the earliest peak under the gap condition was defined as the criterion bandwidth (0 ms bandwidth). Based on this criterion bandwidth, the mean of the relative frequency was calculated for every 10 ms of bandwidth, for the overlap and gap conditions, in each group. Results: Under the overlap condition, for all subjects, the pro-saccade reaction times showed unimodal distribution. The means of the median value of the bandwidth showing the earliest peak for the basketball and table tennis groups (approximate 170 ms) were significantly earlier than that for the control group (approximate 190 ms). Under the gap condition, the distribution was bimodal for 11 of 15 subjects in the basketball group and for 5 of 15 subjects in the control group. In the table tennis group, the distribution was not bimodal but unimodal for all 15 subjects. For the basketball group, mean of the relative frequency showed bimodal distribution with approximate 120 ms and 170 ms peaks. For the table tennis and control groups, the mean of the relative frequency showed unimodal distribution with approximate 130 ms and 140ms peak, respectively. Conclusions: The present study indicated that under the gap condition, the sports experience influenced on the distribution of the pro-saccade reaction time. The pro-saccade reaction time under the condition would show a distinct bimodal distribution for the basketball group and show a distinct and early unimodal distribution for the table tennis group. It was suggested that the physiological factor leading the group difference in the distribution was the effect of sports experience on the disengagement function of fixation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Distribution; Gap condition; Overlap condition; Pro-saccade reaction time; Sports experience","basketball; human; photostimulation; physiology; reaction time; saccadic eye movement; sport; young adult; Basketball; Humans; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Saccades; Sports; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123793539

However, only a few studies have examined the epidemiology of Japanese collegiate men’s basketball injuries. This study investigated the incidence of injury among Japanese collegiate men’s basketball from the 2013/2014 to the 2019/2020 seasons and identified unique patterns by comparing our data with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men’s basketball data. Methods: Data from Japanese collegiate basketball teams of the Kanto Collegiate Basketball Federation Division I League during the 2013/2014 to 2019/2020 academic years (23 team-seasons) were used in this study. Injury rates per 1000 athlete exposures (AEs), injury proportions, and the injury rate ratio (IRR) were calculated according to the events, injury types, body parts, and common injury mechanisms. Injury rates were then compared with that from the time-loss injury data of the NCAA’s previous reports. Results: In total, 480 injuries during 97,515 AEs were reported, leading to an injury rate of 4.92 per 1000 AEs (95% CI = 4.48–5.36). The overall injury rate was higher in Japan than in the NCAA ([2009/2010–2014/2015] IRR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.39–1.73; [2014/2015–2018/2019] IRR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.48–1.82). Lower extremity injuries occurred most frequently (73.5%). Ankle sprain was the most common injury in Japan, with higher injury rates than in the NCAA (IRR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.72–2.57). The injury rate of concussion was lower in Japan than in the NCAA (IRR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.14–0.55). Conclusions: The rates of overall injury and ankle sprain were higher and that of concussion was lower in Japan than in the NCAA. These results suggested the existence of international differences in the pattern or features of injuries in basketball players. © 2022, The Author(s).","Basketball; Collegiate; Injury surveillance","ankle injury; ankle instability; ankle sprain; anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; athletic trainer; basketball player; body regions; cartilage injury; concussion; contusion; hamstring muscle; head injury; human; incidence; injury; intensive care unit; knee injury; knee meniscus rupture; major clinical study; posterior cruciate ligament; risk factor; sport injury; student athlete; tibial tuberosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123066618

Methods: Ten young basketball players (17 ± 1 yrs) performed, in randomized order, RSA test with changes of direction after a standardized warm up followed by drop jumps, heavy sled towing, or no exercise (control condition). Neuromuscular assessments composed of two maximal voluntary contractions of the knee extensors, peripheral nerve stimulation, and surface electromyography (EMG), responses were recorded before and immediately after the RSA. The EMG signal of leg muscles during sprinting were also recorded as well as the blood lactate concentration. Results: The drop jumps improved the RSA mean time (P = 0.033), total time (P = 0.031), and slowest time (P = 0.029) compared to control condition, while heavy sled towing did not change RSA outcomes (P > 0.05). All conditions exhibited a decrease of doublet high frequency stimulation force (pre-post measurement) (P = 0.023) and voluntary activation (P = 0.041), evidencing the occurrence from peripheral and central components of fatigue after RSA, respectively, but no difference was evident between-conditions. There was a significantly greater EMG activity during sprints for the biceps femoris after drop jumps, only when compared to control condition (P = 0.013). Conclusion: Repeated drop jumps were effective to induce PAPE in the form of RSA, while heavy sled towing had no effect on RSA performance in young basketball players. Furthermore, both conditioning activities exhibited similar levels of fatigue following the RSA protocol. Thus, drop jumps may be used as an alternative to induce PAPE and thus improve performance during sprints in young male basketball players. © 2022, The Author(s).","Neuromuscular fatigue; Physical fitness; Post-activation performance enhancement; Post-activation potentiation; Sport","lactic acid; adolescent; Article; basketball player; biceps femoris muscle; clinical article; conditioning; controlled study; crossover procedure; drop jumps; electromyogram; electromyography; exercise; fatigue; force; heavy sled towing; human; knee function; lactate blood level; leg muscle; male; muscle weakness; nerve stimulation; neuromuscular function; randomized controlled trial; repeated sprint ability; sport; stimulation; surface electromyography; warm up",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122326691

The analysis procedures included five U19 and six senior-level games, containing 224 and 252 shooting attempts, respectively. Binary logistic regression identified the opponent’s defensive pressure and shooting distance from the basket as significant predictors of shooting efficiency in both categories. When defensive pressure was high, the chance for the missed shot was 3.5 (95% CI; 1.43–8.52) and 3.19 (95% CI; 1.4–7.26) times more likely than it was under the minimum defensive pressure for U19 and senior category, respectively. Shooting efficiency significantly decreased when the horizontal distance from the basket increased. In U19, a chance for a missed shot was 4.63 (95% CI; 2–10.712) and 5.15 (95% CI; 1.91–13.86) times higher for medium and long-distance (respectively), compared to short-range shooting. In the senior category, the chance for the missed shot was 3.9 (95% CI; 1.83–8.31) and 3.27 (95% CI; 1.43–7.52) times higher for medium and long-distance (respectively) when compared to a short distance. The possession duration, game quarter, and heart rate level were identified as insignificant predictors. Therefore, the aforementioned findings suggest that basketball players and coaches may benefit from designing training sessions where the defender puts pressure on the shooting player as in a real game situation and balanced the frequency of shooting from different distances from the basket.

In addition, the study aimed to determine the attacking and defensive level of the top and bottom eight teams and find their existing problems and shortcomings, to further improve their competitive basketball strength, and also provided valid and reliable information for coaches to conduct targeted training in the future. Methods: The rank-sum ratio (RSR) was employed to evaluate the attack, defense, and overall attacking and defensive performance between the top and bottom teams during the 2019 Men's Basketball World Cup. Additionally, an independent sample T-test was conducted to test the difference in performance indicators of attack and defense between the top eight and bottom eight teams. Spearman Rho Correlation was conducted to determine the relationship between the attacking and defensive RSR value and the final competition ranking at the 0.05 confidence level. Pearson Correlation was employed to test the relationship between the performance indicators and the attacking and defensive RSR value at the 0.05 confidence level. According to Spearman and Pearson Correlation, the indicators which contributed most to the attacking and defensive performance, as well as the correlation between attack and defense and the final ranking, can thus be determined. Results: The results showed that the attacking performance of the top eight teams was far better than the bottom eight teams in terms of average points (p = 0.000), 2-point shoot percentage (p = 0.001), 3-point shoot percentage (p = 0.003), free throw percentage (p = 0.001), turnovers (p = 0.012), and assists (p = 0.000), and there was a significant difference (p < 0.05). However, second attack (p = 0.484), fast-break (p = 0.174), and offensive rebounds (p = 0.261) showed no significant difference between the two cohorts (P > 0.05), and the offensive rebounds of the bottom eight teams were better than the top eight teams. Additionally, there was a large gap between the top eight teams and the bottom eight teams in lost points (p = 0.001) and defensive rebounds (p = 0.000), with a very significant difference (p < 0.01). However, steals (p = 0.760), blocks (p = 0.166), and fouls (p = 0.686) had no significant difference between the two cohorts (P > 0.05). Additionally, there was a very significant difference between attack RSR (p = 0.000), defense RSR (p = 0.006), and the overall attack-defense RSR (p = 0.000) of the top eight and bottom eight teams (p < 0.01), and most top teams focused on developing both attack and defense and paid attention to improve the overall attacking and defensive ability. Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the overall attack-defense performance and assists (p = 0.832), rebounds (p = 0.762), turnovers (p = 0.702), 2-point shoot percentage (p = 0.704), defensive rebounds (p = 0.809), fast-break points (p = 0.577), blocks (p = 0.600), and free throw percentage (p = 0.575). Conclusions: This study showed that the top basketball teams focused on developing both attack and defense, and have the common characteristics of strong attack and defense. Whether it was the attack, defense, or overall attacking and defensive ability, there was a significant relationship with the final ranking. Additionally, this study showed that there were very significant differences in both attacking and defensive abilities between the top eight and bottom eight teams, as well as highlighted their respective advantages and disadvantages in attacking and defensive indicators. Besides that, this study found that performance indicators such as assists, defensive rebounds, 2P%, turnovers, FT%, fast-breaks, and blocks were the main factors that distinguish the top and bottom teams, and they had a significant relationship with overall attacking and defensive performance. The above information allows coaches and players to learn the latest developments in competitive basketball, as well as their advantages and disadvantages, to help them organize targeted training in the future.

For instance, the lowest HR (p < 0.001), average HR (p < 0.001) and total awake time (p = 0.04) were significantly reduced in the NNT group. On the contrary, the control group presented greater values than the NNT group in the subjective Hooper Test, although only stress presented significant differences (Control 2.5 ± 1.2 vs. NNT cost or 3.2 ± 0.9; p = 0.01). Additionally, there were no significant differences in recovery parameters between weeks with one or two matches. In conclusion, the results suggest that players that underwent NNT tended to improve their sleep quality. Nevertheless, player’s values in the biochemical markers and wellness status remained similar in both groups. The fact that no significant differences were found between weeks with one or two matches could help basketball professionals to determine that a congested schedule does not seem to negatively alter recovery status.

The purpose of this study was twofold: (1.) Examine the reliability of kinetic metrics from a single-leg Lateral Countermovement Jump (LCMJ) (2.) Determine if kinetic metrics from the LCMJ can stratify above (i.e., “fast”) or below (i.e., “slow”) median shuffling performance. Twenty professional basketball players participated in the reliability study (21.7 ± 3.5 years, 1.98 ± 0.1 m; 89.9 ± 10.9 kg). One hundred seven professional and thirty-three collegiate basketball players (N = 140) (22.7 ± 3.5 years, 2.0 ± 0.1 m; 98.4 ± 11.9 kg) participated in the experimental study examining the ability of LCMJ kinetics to stratify shuffling performance. Reliability was assessed using Bland–Altman plots, coefficients of variation (CVs), typical errors (TEs), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Anthropometric and LCMJ kinetic differences between fast and slow shufflers were assessed with an independent t-test. Four kinetic metrics (peak vertical force, peak lateral force, relative lateral force, and lateral impulse) met within- and between-session reliability thresholds (CV < 10% and ICC > 0.70). Faster shufflers generated significantly more relative lateral force than their slower counterparts (9.51 ± 0.8 Nx/kg vs. 8.9 ± 0.9 Nx/kg, %Diff 6.3, p < 0.00007, ES = 0.70). Basketball practitioners who have access to triaxial force plates may consider adding the LCMJ into their testing battery, as relative lateral force is a reliable metric that can stratify fast and slow shufflers. © 2022 by the authors.","acceleration; biomechanics; change of direction; force plate; NBA; shuffle; sport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85149462702

The main aim of this study was to identify predictors of RAG among early pubescent boys and girls. The participants were primary school boys (n = 73) and girls (n = 59) aged 11–12. The criterion variable was the originally developed “Triangle” test of reactive agility (Triangle-RAG). Predictors included anthropometric/body composition indices (body height, seated height, body mass, and body fat percentage) and motor abilities (10 and 20 m sprint, broad jump, squat jump, countermovement jump, drop jump, and two tests of change of direction speed—CODS (Triangle-CODS, and 20 yards)). The results of the univariate analysis showed that anthropometric/body composition indices were not significantly correlated to TRAG (0–4% of the common variance), while all motor abilities were significantly associated with TRAG (7–43% of the common variance) in both genders. Among boys, 64% of the TRAG variance was explained by multiple regression, with TCODS as the only significant predictor. Among girls, multiple regression explained 59% of the TRAG-variance with TCODS, countermovement jump, and drop jump as significant predictors. Differences in multivariate results between genders can be explained by (i) greater involvement in agility-saturated sports (i.e., basketball, tennis, soccer) in boys, and (ii) advanced maturity status in girls. The lack of association between anthropometric/body built and TRAG was influenced by the short duration of the TRAG (3.54 ± 0.4 s). Our findings suggest that pre-pubescent and early pubescent children should be systematically trained on basic motor abilities to achieve fundamentals for further developing RAG. Since in this study we observed predictors including only athletic abilities and anthropometric/body composition, in future studies, other motor abilities, as well as cognitive, perceptual, and decision-making parameters as potential predictors of RAG in children should be investigated. © 2022 by the authors.","anthropometry; children; non-planned agility; pre-planned agility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85149456315

Purpose: To determine if surgical fixation of chondral-only fragments in the juvenile knee results in an adequate healing response with successful imaging and clinical outcomes. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Data were collected on 16 skeletally immature patients treated with fixation of chondral-only fragments with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Patients were selected by the operating surgeons based on the quality and size of the chondral fragment. Demographic data, lesion characteristics, surgical procedure details, complications, and postoperative imaging were assessed. Validated outcome measures were collected pre- and postoperatively and included the following scores: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Marx Activity Scale, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity–Brief Scale (HSS Pedi-FABS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)–Physical Health and PROMIS–Psychological Health, and Tegner. Results: The mean age of our patient cohort was 14.9 years. The mean size of the repaired defects measured 3.2 cm2. Injury sites included the patella (n = 1), medial femoral condyle (n = 3), trochlea (n = 4), and lateral femoral condyle (n = 8). Within the mean follow-up time of 42.3 months (range, 15-145), there was 1 clinical failure with loosening of the chondral fragment and the need for reoperation. At a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, the mean (interquartile range) patient-reported outcome scores were as follows: IKDC, 95.2 (94.3-100); Marx Activity Scale, 11.5 (11.5-16); KOOS, 95.81 (93.5-95.81); HSS Pedi-FABS, 16.94 (11.5-26); PROMIS–Physical Health, 93.75% (90%-100%); PROMIS–Psychological Health, 90% (88.75%-100%); and Tegner, 5.69 (4.75-7). All patients who were engaged in sports before injury returned to the same or higher level of competition with the exception of 1 patient. Conclusion: Primary repair of chondral-only injuries with internal fixation can be a successful treatment option in selected patients. Clinical and imaging results at final follow-up suggest that reintegration of the cartilage fragment is achievable and leads to excellent clinical function and a high return-to-sports rate. © The Author(s) 2022.","cartilage fragment; chondral injury; chondral-only fragment; fixation; osteochondral defect","adolescent; arthroscopy; arthrotomy; Article; articular cartilage; baseball player; basketball player; bleeding; bone maturation; cartilage injury; child; clinical article; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; demographics; female; femoral condyle; follow up; football player; fracture fixation; healing; health; hematoma; human; International Knee Documentation Committee scale; juvenile; knee; knee injury; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; knee instability; knee pain; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; open surgery; osteosynthesis; outcome assessment; patella; patient-reported outcome; physiotherapy; psychological well-being; reoperation; retrospective study; scar tissue; school child; soccer player; sport; surgical technique; T2 weighted imaging; Tegner activity score; weight bearing; wrestling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85142904712

Purpose: To investigate whether sex is a predictor of outcomes in studies evaluating hip arthroscopic surgery for FAIS. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Ovid, and PubMed Central databases for English-language studies that evaluated sex-specific outcomes in human populations. The search terms used were as follows: (“Hip Arthroscopy”) AND (“Femoroacetabular Impingement” OR “FAI”) AND (“Sex” OR “Gender” OR “Male” OR “Female”). Studies with evidence levels 2 through 4 were included. The studies were then screened, followed by data extraction. Modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) outcomes and return-to-sport (RTS) rates were recorded. These were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was calculated using the I2 statistic. Results: Of 256 full-text articles screened, 48 articles were included in this analysis; of these, 14 studies (29%) concluded that female sex was a negative predictor of postoperative outcomes, while 6 studies (13%) found female sex to be positive predictor. The remaining 28 studies (58%) found no sex-based differences in postoperative outcomes. Of 7 studies (416 male and 519 female) included in the mHHS analysis, 2 studies concluded that male patients had significantly higher postoperative mHHS scores. Of 6 studies (502 male and 396 female) included in the RTS analysis, 1 study concluded that male patients had a significantly higher RTS rate. Conclusion: Almost one-third of the included studies determined that female sex was a negative predictor of postoperative outcomes, 13% found female sex to be a positive predictor, and 58% found no sex-based differences. Our study illustrates an insufficiency of high-level evidence supporting sex-specific differences in outcomes after hip arthroscopic surgery, but findings indicated that the postoperative mHHS score and RTS rate may be influenced by sex. © The Author(s) 2022.","femoroacetabular impingement syndrome; hip arthroscopic surgery; sex-based outcomes","athlete; baseball; basketball; cadaver; cartilage injury; chondroplasty; clinical outcome; dancing; dispersity; femoral osteotomy; femoroacetabular impingement; fencing (sport); football; golf; gymnastics; hip arthroscopy; hockey; human; lacrosse player; meta analysis; microfracture (procedure); osteoarthritis; periacetabular osteotomy; postoperative care; randomized controlled trial (topic); return to sport; Review; rowing; rugby; running; sex difference; sexual behavior; soccer; softball; swimming; systematic review; tennis; triathlon; volleyball; water polo; wrestling",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85142756403

It is a quasi-experimental study with a pre/post-test control design. The participants were divided into a yoga group and a control group. A Functional Movement Screen and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale were used to assess participants’ basic movement patterns and mindfulness before and after 12 weeks of yoga intervention (two classes per week, 90 min per class). The results show that the yoga group’s FMS scores improved more compared to the control group [F(1,78) = 29.08, p &lt; 0.001, ŋp2 = 0.27], and that the scores for the deep squat (ŋp2 = 0.4), shoulder mobility (ŋp2 = 0.17), and trunk stability pushup (ŋp2 = 0.36) improved substantially.

Two scenarios of the Five-Time Shuttle Run to Gates test (planned and unplanned) were used to evaluate the CODS and AG. Two forms of models were built to assess functional forms of the relationships between CODS and AG vs. BH and BMI: simple linear regression and binomial curvilinear regression for each type of team sport. The results confirmed the relationships between both anthropometric measurements and motor abilities only in HB, whereas in BB only a significant relationship was noted between BH and AG. Moreover, two curvilinear functional forms of the relationship were identified: inverted L-shape and inverted U-shape. Therefore, it was concluded that the first form of function indicated an initially proportional relationship between anthropometric measurement and motor test results and plateau after reaching a certain value of the BH or BMI. Similarly, the second form of function indicated the peak value of the BH or BMI which is threshold for the value of the anthropometric measurement when a progressive effect in the functional feature occurs. © 2022 by the authors.","cognitive motor skills; competitive sport; performance analysis; team sport","body mass; cognition; height; locomotion; public health; sport; adult; agility; anthropometry; article; basketball; body height; body mass; controlled study; female; human; linear regression analysis; motor performance; team sport; velocity; athletic performance; body height; body mass; Athletic Performance; Basketball; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Female; Humans; Team Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85142477677

However, the differences in rules between two basketball disciplines can affect thinking, behaviour, and decisions of the players. A core difference between two disciplines is the value of the shots. In 5v5, long-range shots are worth three points and close-range two, while in 3x3, their values are two and one points, respectively. As the value ratio of the close and long-range shots is greater in 3x3, we assume that players make different decisions about their shot selection in 3x3 than in 5v5, which can affect offensive efficiency. Methods: We analysed game statistics of the 2019 men’s 5v5 and 3x3 Basketball World Cups. Besides regular statistical indicators, we applied relative offensive rating to be able to compare the two disciplines. Results: The analysis of relative offensive rating showed that offences are more effective in 5v5 than in 3x3. We also found significant difference in shot selection and efficiency. In 3x3, there is a higher proportion of the shots than in 5v5, but long-range shots are more successful in 5v5. Conclusions: For rule differences that affect player’s shot selection and affect offensive efficiency, their decisions are characterized by ecological dynamics and naturalistic decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.","3x3; basketball; behaviour; decision-making; offensive efficiency; offensive rating; shot selection","decision making; sport; adult; article; basketball; case report; clinical article; decision making; human; human experiment; male; productivity; soccer; Basketball; Efficiency; Humans; Male; Soccer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85142458610

Accordingly, in 12 elite athletes, we compared the effects of both GSE and placebo (PL) on submaximal VO2, time to exhaustion performance, and endothelial function during progressive cycling exercise for 14 days. Endothelial function was evaluated from the brachial artery via flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Compared to PL, GSE decreased submaximal VO2 at 80% and 120% of VO2peak and increased the time to exhaustion (p &lt; 0.05). GSE also resulted in FMD-induced increase in brachial artery diameter (14.4 ± 5.2% vs. 17.6 ± 4.5%, p = 0.035). We demonstrated that chronic supplementation with GSE improved endurance performance and these effects may partially be due to vasodilation in active skeletal muscle mediated by enhanced endothelial function. Thus, our results suggest that GSE appears to be an ergogenic nutraceutical that can improve exercise performance in elite athletes. © 2022 by the authors.","basketball players; endothelial function; endurance performance; grape seed extract; oxygen consumption","grape seed extract; meganaturalb beta; placebo; antioxidant; grape seed extract; polyphenol; cell; oxygen consumption; performance assessment; physical activity; plant extract; sport; adult; artery diameter; artery endothelium; Article; athletic performance; basketball player; bicycle exercise test; blood vessel function; brachial artery; controlled study; crossover procedure; diet supplementation; double blind procedure; elite athlete; endothelial function; endurance; experimental study; flow-mediated dilation test; human; human experiment; maximal oxygen uptake; morning dosage; normal human; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; student athlete; basketball; dietary supplement; Antioxidants; Basketball; Dietary Supplements; Grape Seed Extract; Humans; Polyphenols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85141636842

Although biomechanical analysis could help to detect it, aspects such as irregular menstruation make these associations controversial. We aimed to evaluate associations between 2D biomechanics during landing and proprioception with ankle and knee injuries of female basketball players, considering their menstruation regularity. Seventy-one players participated in this study. In the preseason, participants performed a drop-jump to obtain biomechanics during landing and a weight-bearing proprioception test. During the competitive season, all the non-contact ankle and knee injuries were registered. Data showed that 16% of players sustained an ankle or knee injury, being more frequent in players with irregular menstruation compared to regulars (22% vs. 13%, χ2 = 6.009, p = 0.050, d = 0.6). Players who sustained a left-side injury displayed higher left-side dynamic valgus during landing than uninjured players (χ2 = 25.88, p = 0.006, d = 1.5). The rest of the variables did not show any significant difference (p &gt; 0.05). Monitoring 2D dynamic valgus from a drop-jump could help to detect inadequate motor control that may facilitate ankle or knee injuries of female basketball players, mainly for those with irregular menstruation. Proprioception seems not to be related to injuries. © 2022 by the authors.","biomechanical phenomena; lower limb injury; menstruation disturbances","biomechanics; cohort analysis; female; injury; movement; reproductive cycle; sport; womens health; adult; ankle injury; Article; basketball player; biomechanics; clinical article; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease registry; female; human; jumping; knee injury; lower limb; menstrual cycle; menstrual irregularity; motor control; outcome assessment; patient monitoring; patient participation; proprioception; valgus knee; weight bearing; young adult; ankle; basketball; knee; menstrual cycle; menstruation disorder; Ankle; Basketball; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Menstrual Cycle; Menstruation Disturbances",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85141579115

Case presentation: Here we reported 2 patients presenting knee swelling, pain, and giving away symptoms following a rupture of ACL history. Clinical and radiological findings were supportive of ACL rupture and PVNS, prompting the patient to undergo surgery. The synovium was completely removed with the help of an arthroscope. Reconstruction of the ruptured ACL was carried out a few months later. At the last follow-up visit, both the patients were doing well with no recurrence of pain, swelling, or give way sensation. Discussion: The diagnosis of PVNS is often difficult because in the early stages, symptoms are often non-specific and pathological examination remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of PVNS. We have reviewed some of the previously reported literature on PVNS, suggesting that joint instability may be an important risk factor for PVNS and summarizing the treatment options for PVNS. Conclusion: More attention should be paid to the incidence of PVNS in patients with joint instability, particularly in patients with cruciate ligament injuries. Early and reliable stabilization of the joint may significantly prevent PVNS and ensure a better clinical outcome. © 2022","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Case report; Knee joint; Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis","C reactive protein; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; Article; basketball; case report; clinical article; clinical examination; clinical outcome; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; follow up; histiocyte; human; incidence; joint effusion; joint instability; joint swelling; knee arthroscopy; knee pain; laboratory test; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical examination; pigmented villonodular synovitis; sport injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140874329

Therefore, our objective was to meta-analyze the effects of PJT on physical fitness attributes in basketball players, in comparison to a control condition. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, up to July 2020. Peer-reviewed controlled trials with baseline and follow-up measurements investigating the effects of PJT on physical fitness attributes (muscle power, i.e., jumping performance, linear sprint speed, change-of-direction speed, balance, and muscle strength) in basketball players, with no restrictions on their playing level, sex, or age. Hedge's g effect sizes (ES) were calculated for physical fitness variables. Using a random-effects model, potential sources of heterogeneity were selected, including subgroup analyses (age, sex, body mass, and height) and single training factor analysis (program duration, training frequency, and total number of training sessions). Computation of meta-regression was also performed. Results: Thirty-two studies were included, involving 818 total basketball players. Significant (p < 0.05) small-to-large effects of PJT were evident on vertical jump power (ES = 0.45), countermovement jump height with (ES = 1.24) and without arm swing (ES = 0.88), squat jump height (ES = 0.80), drop jump height (ES = 0.53), horizontal jump distance (ES = 0.65), linear sprint time across distances ≤10 m (ES = 1.67) and >10 m (ES = 0.92), change-of-direction performance time across distances ≤40 m (ES = 1.15) and >40 m (ES = 1.02), dynamic (ES = 1.16) and static balance (ES = 1.48), and maximal strength (ES = 0.57). The meta-regression revealed that training duration, training frequency, and total number of sessions completed did not predict the effects of PJT on physical fitness attributes. Subgroup analysis indicated greater improvements in older compared to younger players in horizontal jump distance (>17.15 years, ES = 2.11; ≤17.15 years, ES = 0.10; p < 0.001), linear sprint time >10 m (>16.3 years, ES = 1.83; ≤16.3 years, ES = 0.36; p = 0.010), and change-of-direction performance time ≤40 m (>16.3 years, ES = 1.65; ≤16.3 years, ES = 0.75; p = 0.005). Greater increases in horizontal jump distance were apparent with >2 compared with ≤2 weekly PJT sessions (ES = 2.12 and ES = 0.39, respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Data from 32 studies (28 of which demonstrate moderate-to-high methodological quality) indicate PJT improves muscle power, linear sprint speed, change-of-direction speed, balance, and muscle strength in basketball players independent of sex, age, or PJT program variables. However, the beneficial effects of PJT as measured by horizontal jump distance, linear sprint time >10 m, and change-of-direction performance time ≤40 m, appear to be more evident among older basketball players. © 2021","Exercise therapy; Human physical conditioning; Resistance training; Stretch reflex; Team sports","basketball player; controlled clinical trial (topic); controlled study; effect size; factor analysis; female; follow up; human; jumping; kinesiotherapy; male; Medline; meta analysis; muscle strength; myotatic reflex; resistance training; review; Scopus; systematic review; team sport; Web of Science",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101303302

The purpose of this study was to compare the lower limb differences in movement patterns, muscle forces and ACL forces during drop landing (DL), drop vertical jump (DVJ) and forward vertical jump (FVJ). Methods: Eleven basketball and volleyball female college athletes (Division II and I) were recruited. Landing actions of DL, DVJ and FVJ, kinematics and dynamics data were collected synchronously using a motion capture system. OpenSim was used to calculate the ACL load, knee joint angle and moment, and muscle force. Results: At initial contact, different landing movements influenced knee flexion angle; DL action was significantly less than FVJ action (p = 0.046). Different landing actions affected quadriceps femoris forces; FVJ was significantly greater than DL and DVJ actions (p = 0.002 and p = 0.037, respectively). However, different landing movements had no significant effects on other variables (knee extension moment, knee valgus angle and moment, hamstring and gastrocnemius muscle forces, and ACL forces) (p > 0.050). Conclusion: There was no significant difference in the knee valgus, knee valgus moment, and the ACL forces between the three landing actions. However, knee flexion angle, knee extension moments sagittal factors, and quadriceps and gastrocnemius forces are critical factors for ACL injury. The DL action had a significantly smaller knee flexion angle, which may increase the risk of ACL injury, and not recommended to assess the risk of ACL injuries. The FVJ action had a larger knee flexion angle and higher quadriceps femoris forces that were more in line with daily training and competition needs. Therefore, it is recommended to use FVJ action in future studies on risk assessment of ACL injuries and injury prevention in female college athletes.

Twenty-one well-trained collegiate basketball players were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (variable resistance training) or a control group (constant resistance training) and completed a twice weekly training program over an 8-week period. Training programs were the same except that the experimental group included variable resistance via elastic bands (40% of the total load). Maximum strength, vertical jump, horizontal jump, and sprint performance were assessed pre- A nd post-intervention. Both groups demonstrated significant increases in the back squat 1RM (experimental group +36.5% and control group +32.3%, both p < 0.001), countermovement jump (experimental group +12.9%, p = 0.002 and control group +5.6%, p = 0.02), and squat jump performance (experimental group +21.4% and control group +12.9%, both p < 0.001), whereas standing broad jump performance improved only in the experimental group (+2.9%, p = 0.029). Additionally, the experimental group showed significant improvement in the squat jump (p = 0.014) compared with the control group. However, no statistically significant differences were found between groups for countermovement jump (p = 0.06) and sprint performance at 10 m (p = 0.153) and 20 m (p = 0.076). We may conclude that both training modalities showed similar improvements in maximum strength.

This decision to not play in order to rest the player, aptly noted as a DNP-Rest decision on injury reports, is in line with team and player goals, and fits with a growing body of evidence in support of the power of rest for health and performance. However, these practices conflict with some goals of the league, which has a vested interest in having the top talent play to attract broadcasters, advertisers, live spectators, and thus, enhance viewership. The current study is among the first to test the theory that strategically resting healthy players during the regular season results in better performance, as indicated by Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Win Shares, during the post-season. Utilizing data from the 2016–17 through the 2020–21 NBA seasons, there was not sufficient evidence to suggest that resting more games during the regular season results in better performance in the post-season. Findings from a nested case-control study of 184 players (92 cases; 92 controls) also showed no differences in the change in performance from regular to post-season between cases of players who received rest during the regular season and matched controls. Although the restorative effects of rest might be considerable in the short term, the current study provides additional evidence to suggest that the impact may not carry over into the post-season.

A total of six men's college basketball players participated in this study. A wireless electromyographic system was used to measure the activity of 16 trunk, and upper and lower extremity muscles while completing the free throw. In total, three scored and missed shots each were analyzed to extract the synergies using non-negative matrix factorization. Overall, four synergies were extracted from the successfully made shots, and three synergies were extracted for the missed shot; two synergies were shared between scored and missed shots. The one synergy that contributes to the shoulder flexion was used to set the ball and activate the initial stage of the free throw. Another synergy that contributes the palmar flexion was used to release the ball and activate the final stage of the free throw. The other two synergies in scored shot contribute to lower and upper limb extension in sequence to promote the energy transfer in the middle to the final stage of the free throw. On the other hand, there was only a synergy that corresponded to the middle to the final stage of the free throw extracted from the missed shot. Since the movements of the lower and upper extremity extensions are performed even on a missed shot, we believe that working the from the lower to the upper limb “in sequence,” rather than working the lower and upper limbs “simultaneously,” may influence the success of the shot.

The research goal is to establish and compare the anthropometric characteristics, body composition, and somatotype components of Kosovo’s young elite athletes. The research was conducted on 255 young athletes aged 18, divided into 92 footballers, 83 basket players, and 80 handball players. The obtained results show numerous relations and differences between the tested young athletes. The research results suggest that footballers are shorter and lighter than basketball and handball players; have lower BMI than handball players. Handball players are shorter than basketball players, and have greater BMI than basketball players and footballers. Footballers, compared to handball players have a greater bone-component and less fat-component percentage. Basketball players possess greater bone-component percentage values than handball players. Footballers have a dominant mesomorph component. Their somatotype category is balanced mesomorph. Handball players are established to have a common mesomorph athletic type with a characteristic skeleton’s longitudinal dimension. The ectomorph body type is dominant in basketball players – a mesomorph- body type with a characteristic skeleton’s longitudinal dimension and balanced correlation between the bone and muscle tissue. Therefore, these findings may give coaches from the region better working knowledge and suggest to them to follow recent selection process methods and be more diligent during the process of talent scouting. © 2022 Montenegrin Sports Academy.

Therefore, by meeting physiological needs in accordance with a rational diet, athletes can adapt more quickly to the applied physical load and achieve better sport results. The aim of the study was to describe and compare the factors that determine the healthy diet of athletes of various sports. The study, which aimed to assess the factors determining healthy diet, involved 157 students of physical education and sports studies from the University of Almaty. Respondents were divided into 3 groups - sports games (volleyball, football, basketball, tennis) (n=85), endurance sports (long distance running, skiing, road cycling, triathlon (n=22), and combat sports (wrestling, judo, karate, boxing) (n=50). The questionnaire by Steptoe et al. (1995) was employed to establish the opinion of the investigated subjects on the factors that determine healthy and rational dietary choices of student athletes. Our research has shown that among the factors that determine the healthy diet of athletes of various sports, the main ones are health, the character of the chosen sport, and the athlete’s body composition. Factors such as current trends, the popularity of the food consumed, and the influence of family and friends are less important. The athletes we studied noted their efforts to eat and live healthy, most of them were satisfied with their health and their body mass. A greater variety in respondents’ responses was observed when assessing the composition of food supplements, the impact of discount special offers on product selection. The responses received on adherence to the diet indicate that the athletes studied do not always observe the correct diet. © 2022 Montenegrin Sports Academy.

The sample consisted of a total of 746 matches during 2019-2020 season, 424 matches from the Men's First Division (ACB) and 322 matches from the Women's First Division (Liga Endesa). To evaluate the study objective, covariation analysis and decision trees were used. The results showed in men's basketball a moderate association in the first and third quarters with the match outcome, while in women's basketball a high association in the first quarter and a moderate association in the second and last quarter. The decision trees indicated that the third and first quarter influence in greater probability of winning in men's basketball, instead, in women's basketball the most determining quarters for winning are the first and second. In conclusion, the obtained results realize the first approximation to the analysis of the dynamics of the partial score in the final outcome of basketball matches. Each competition has specific characteristics in the influence of the partial score on the final outcome. While for men it is very important to take the initiative at the start of the second half (Q3), for women the start of the game is decisive (Q1). The composition of the quintets, the rotations of the players and the rhythm of the match are actions the coaches will control to guarantee the partial success and the final success. © 2022 Revista Internacional de Ciencias del Deporte.

Twenty male basketball players (age: 23 + 0.6 years; body mass: 78.3 + 4.8 kg; height:185.3 + 5.4 cm, %BF, 15.2 ± 4.8) volunteered to participate in this study. They were divided into a β-alanine group (BG, N = 10) and a placebo group (PG, N = 10). All players were preparing for university competitions and had played for over five years. Players used 6.4 g/d of β-alanine in BG and maltodextrin in PG. The participants were involved in regular basketball training three months before the study. CRP, IL-6, body composition parameters, and bio-motor abilities were measured before starting the exercises and after completing the eight-week training period. The research findings showed a significant decrease in CRP and IL-6 and an increase in anaerobic peak power between the pre-test and post-test, as well as between BG and PG groups (p < 0.05). Although the other measured factors were a relative improvement compared to the pre-test and also compared to PG, these changes were not statistically significant (p < 0.05). Eight weeks of β-alanine supplementation ameliorated increases in IL-6 and CRP associated with in-season physical stressors in collegiate basketball players. These changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines suggest that β-alanine supplementation may be a useful nutritional strategy for immune regulation and can also improve anaerobic performance compared to PG. © 2022 by the authors.","basketball; beta-alanine; performance; pro-inflammatory; youth sports","beta alanine; C reactive protein; interleukin 6; maltodextrin; placebo; beta alanine; C reactive protein; interleukin 6; amino acid; locomotion; male; performance assessment; protein; sport; young population; adult; anaerobic capacity; Article; basketball; basketball player; body composition; controlled study; elite athlete; exercise; human; immunoregulation; inflammation; male; motor performance; physical stress; randomized controlled trial; treatment duration; basketball; body composition; dietary supplement; physiology; young adult; Adult; Basketball; beta-Alanine; Body Composition; C-Reactive Protein; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Interleukin-6; Male; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140745432

However, there is a lack of scientific literature studying how strength relates to shooting proficiency, as a key basketball skill capable of discriminating winning from losing game outcomes. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between maximal upper and lower body strength and free-throw, two-point, and three-point shooting accuracy. Ten males and seven females performed bench press and back squat one repetition maximum (1RM) and basketball shooting testing during two laboratory visits. The shooting protocol consisted of five sets of 15 free-throw, two-point, and three-point shots performed in sequential order. Each set was separated by a 30 min rest interval to minimize the influence of fatigue. Each subject attempted 225 shots, combining for a total of 3825 shots. The average free-throw, two-point, and three-point shooting accuracy for men were 74.5 ± 11.9, 68.4 ± 9.9, and 53.3 ± 14.9%, and for women 79.2 ± 11.2, 65.5 ± 8.4, and 51.2 ± 15.3%, respectively. The average bench press and back squat 1RM for men was 88.2 ± 18.6 and 117.0 ± 21.2 kg, and for women, 40.6 ± 7.5 and 66.9 ± 9.9 kg, respectively. The findings of the present study revealed no significant relationships between maximal upper and lower body strength and basketball shooting performance for both male and female participants.

An adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for critical appraisal. Two reviewers were involved in literature searching, data extraction, and quality review. Two prospective cohort and five cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria, providing 849 subjects (male:female: 436:413). Five studies found BW is associated with PT. Three studies found a relationship between BMI and PT. Six out of seven studies were classified as very good studies. All studies were level IV evidence. The very low certainty evidence suggests an association between BW and PT. There is moderate certainty evidence that BMI is associated with PT. These preliminary findings should be treated cautiously due to the lack of strong evidence. © 2022 by the authors.","Body Mass Index (BMI); Body Weight (BW); elite basketball players; elite volleyball players; Patellar Tendiopathy (PT)",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140642960

In addition to ACL rupture, Segond fractures have also been noted to be associated with significant intra-articular pathology such as meniscal injuries as well as extra-articular pathology such as collateral ligament injuries. This is likely due to the fact that the presence of a Segond fracture may represent increased rotatory instability. Whilst several studies have demonstrated the association of a Segond fracture with significant intra-articular pathology, there is a paucity of literature assessing if the combination of an ACL rupture and Segond fracture gives rise to higher rates of concomitant ligamentous and meniscal injuries. The primary objective of this study is to determine if patients with ACL ruptures associated with Segond fractures have higher rates of concomitant ligamentous and meniscal injury, when compared to patients with ACL ruptures without a Segond fracture. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent ACL reconstruction in a single institution between 2014 to 2018 was conducted. A review of the patients’ demographics, operative notes, and radiographs was performed. X-rays and MRI scans were double-read by a board-certified radiologist and Orthopaedic surgeon. Results: A total of 414 subjects were included. The incidence of Segond fracture was 2.4%. The mean age was 24.7±7.4 (range 16 to 60) years and 26.7±7.6 (range 16 to 38) years in patients with and without Segond fractures respectively. 89.9% of patients suffered a non-contact mechanism of injury, with sports injuries being most common (79.5%). There was a significantly higher rate of isolated lateral meniscus tears in patients with Segond fractures compared to those without (50% v.s. 20.8%) based on pre-operative MRI. (p<0.05) There were no other significant differences in associated ligamentous injuries. Conclusion: The incidence of Segond fracture associated with ACL rupture is 2.4%. There is a significantly higher risk of a concomitant isolated lateral meniscus tear in ACL ruptures associated with a Segond fracture. There is no significantly higher risk of concomitant ligamentous injuries in ACL ruptures associated with a Segond fracture. © 2022 Asia Pacific Knee, Arthroscopy and Sports Medicine Society","Arthroscopy; Instability; Knee; Ligament","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; Article; avulsion fracture; badminton; basketball; bone marrow edema; demographics; descriptive research; female; football; human; incidence; intraarticular fracture; knee meniscus rupture; lateral collateral ligament; lateral meniscus; ligament injury; major clinical study; male; martial art; medial collateral ligament; medial meniscus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; posterior cruciate ligament; retrospective study; segond fracture; soccer; sport injury; X ray analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140271944

The most important attribute for the making of athletes is polished sports talent, followed by psychological, environmental, and incentive factors. Our laboratory studies a red blood cell (RBC) type called GP.Mur, which is rare in most parts of the world besides Southeast Asia. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the GP.Mur blood type is relatively high among Taiwanese elite athletes. The highest frequency of the GP.Mur blood type worldwide is found among Taiwan’s Ami people (88–95% from hospital blood bank surveys in the 1980s). Though the Ami constitute only 0.6–0.8% of the Taiwanese population, from records of national track-and-field games in the past century, 10–60% of the medalists were Ami. Biologically, GP.Mur expression supports blood CO2 metabolism, which may have implications for athleticism. As many of our study subjects are elite college athletes with the GP.Mur blood type, we contemplated their upbringings and career dilemmas, especially during the difficult COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond individual sports talent, the pandemic particularly tests personal characteristics and socioeconomic support for becoming an athlete. © 2022 by the authors.","blood type; career; community; environment; GP.Mur; imagery; psychological trait; sport gene; sport talent","alpha actinin 3; blood group antigen; carbon dioxide; blood; COVID-19; epidemic; gene expression; imagery; indigenous population; metabolism; pandemic; sport; ACTN3 gene; allele; anaerobic threshold; archery; Article; athletic performance; badminton; baseball; basketball; boxing; cardiopulmonary exercise test; career; CO2 metabolism; competitive behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; cycling; elite athlete; environment; erythrocyte; gene; gene expression; genetic polymorphism; golf; GP.Mur; GYPB gene; health care policy; human; incentive; javelin; judo; jumping; karate; marathon; maximal oxygen uptake; mental performance; metabolism; motivation; national lockdown; personality; proteomics; psychological well-being; public health service; rowing; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; soccer; social distancing; social isolation; soft tennis; sport; student athlete; swimming; Taiwan; Taiwanese; track and field; travel restriction; triathlon; weight lifting; adolescent; athlete; child; epidemiology; pandemic; sport; Taiwan; Adolescent; Athletes; Blood Group Antigens; Carbon Dioxide; Child; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140099156

It aims to help athletes maintain effective attentional focus regardless of the disruptive sensations and thoughts induced by the performance situation. It is inspired by Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction and Acceptance Commitment Therapy programmes and has been adapted to the specificities of sport. It is composed of three steps: (a) psychoeducation and identification of the focus of attention, (b) mindfulness and acceptance training, and (c) integrating skills acquired into training and competition. This article reports the effects of MFP in two studies in national basketball players and in young table tennis players. The first study showed that mindfulness skills and free-throw accuracy during basketball games increased more in the experimental group than in the control group. Table tennis results revealed that participants who showed the highest percentage of adherence to the programme benefited more from MFP training in terms of performance outcome (i.e., accumulated points collected from published results compared with the baseline phase) than participants who showed weaker percentages of adherence to the programme. Both studies provided some evidence on the effects of MFP on specific performance indicators (i.e., free-throw accuracy in basketball and ranking points in table tennis), but this needs to be confirmed by further research measuring other relevant performance indicators. The impact and conditions of adherence also deserve more consideration. © 2022 by the authors.","basketball; Mindfulness; performance; table tennis","accuracy assessment; health education; mental health; performance assessment; physical activity; psychology; research work; sport; adult; article; athlete; attention; basketball; basketball player; competition; controlled study; human; mindfulness; mindfulness-based stress reduction; performance indicator; psychoeducation; skill; tennis; Athletes; Basketball; Humans; Mindfulness; Tennis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139970683

This study aimed to determine the effects of a 9-week training intervention involving differential repeated sprint training on a series of physical tests in youth basketball players. A total of 29 participants with different maturity statuses (pre-peak height velocity (PHV), n = 7; mid-PHV, n = 6; post-PHV, n = 16) completed 2 sessions per week of differential repeated sprint training for a period of 9 weeks. Sessions consisted of 2 × 10 repetitions sprints of 20-m whereby participants were instructed to perform various additional fluctuations for each repetition. Before and after the training intervention, participants completed jumping tests (countermovement jump (CMJ), single-leg CMJs, the modified 505 agility test, and straight sprinting tests (0–10 splits time), and maturity status was evaluated as well. Within-group analysis showed improvement in CMJ asymmetries and changes in direction asymmetries and 10-m sprint performance for the pre-, mid-, and post-PHV groups, respectively (p < 0.05), with large to very large effects. Analysis of covariance demonstrated that changes in sprint time in post-PHV players were greater than in the pre- and mid-PHV groups (p < 0.05), with moderate effect. Adding random fluctuations during repeated sprint training appear to be a suitable and feasible training strategy for maintaining and enhancing physical performance in youth basketball players, irrespective of maturity status. Furthermore, the present findings encourage practitioners to implement the present approach in youth athletes to improve their physical performance, but they should be aware that training response can vary according to maturity status. © 2022 by the authors.","adolescence; bilateral asymmetry; growth; maturation; movement variability; puberty; team sports; variation","asymmetry; movement; physical activity; sport; training; young population; adult; agility; analysis of covariance; article; athlete; basketball player; clinical article; female; human; human experiment; jumping; juvenile; leg; male; maturity; physical performance; physician; puberty; team sport; adolescent; athlete; athletic performance; basketball; physiology; running; Adolescent; Athletes; Athletic Performance; Basketball; Humans; Physical Functional Performance; Running",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139811519

Purpose: To provide insight on the identification and management of potential risk factors associated with lower extremity stress fractures in NBA athletes. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using the NBA electronic medical record database for all players who were on an NBA roster for ≥1 game from the 2013-2014 through 2018-2019 seasons. Player characteristics, games missed, and treatment methodology were independently analyzed. Results were presented as incidence per 1000 player-games. Results: There were 22 stress fractures identified in 20 NBA players over the course of 6 years, with an average of 3.67 stress fractures per year and an incidence of 0.12 stress fractures per 1000 player-games. Most stress fractures occurred in the foot (17/22), and 45% (10/22) of stress fractures were treated surgically, with the most common site of operation being the navicular. On average, approximately 37 games and 243 days were missed per stress fracture injury. There was no significant difference in time to return to play between high-risk stress fractures treated operatively versus nonoperatively (269.2 vs 243.8 days; P =.82). Conclusion: The overall incidence of stress fractures in NBA players was 0.12 per 1000 player-games, and a high percentage of players returned to NBA activity after the injury. There was a relatively even distribution between high-risk stress fractures treated operatively and nonoperatively. When comparing high-risk stress fractures treated operatively to ones treated nonoperatively, no significant difference in average time to return to play in the NBA was found. © The Author(s) 2022.","EMR; National Basketball Association (NBA); stress fracture","adult; Article; athlete; basketball; basketball player; body mass; clinical outcome; female; foot fracture; human; incidence; lower limb; male; navicular bone; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; open fracture reduction; osteosynthesis; outcome assessment; physical activity; physical examination; radiography; retrospective study; return to sport; risk factor; stress fracture; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139463937

Methods: Publicly available player records of active NBA players between the 2015 and 2020 seasons (excluding the shortened 2019 season) were reviewed to identify players with a knee injury associated with missing one or more games. Player demographics, anthropometric measurements, statistics, injury characteristics, and history of other lower-extremity injuries were recorded. We sought factors associated with having a structural knee injury in bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Negative binomial regression was conducted to evaluate factors associated with the total number of games missed. Results: Two hundred twelve players (of 1,011, 21%) sustained a structural knee injury. Accounting for potential confounders, having a structural knee injury was associated with more minutes per game played (odds ratio [OR] 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.2; P = .002), a greater usage rate (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P = .004), and a lower player efficiency rating (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89-1.0; P = .041). A greater number of missed games was associated with more minutes per game (regression coefficient [RC] 0.065; 0.028-0.10; P = .001), fewer points per game (RC –0.078; –0.14 to –0.017; P = .013), and greater usage rate (RC 0.032; 0.0040-0.060; P = .025). Conclusions: Structural knee injuries occurred in 21% of players in this study with an overall rate of 5.42 injuries per 1,000 game exposures. Significant risk factors associated with injury were minutes per game, usage rate, and true shooting percentage. Player efficiency was significantly associated with a decreased risk of injury. Increased minutes per game and usage rate were significantly associated with a longer duration of game loss.

Results: Marketing and promotion of sports betting were more prominent for sports betting in Australia and the United Kingdom. Interviews with sports bettors demonstrated that sports betting is persuasive and normalized. Psychosocial problems do not appear to differ greatly by country, and sports betting appears to be associated with elevated levels of problem gambling. Responsible gambling approaches have helped address risky sports betting behaviors. China and South Korea have imposed more strict regulations and restrictions on sports betting access in comparison to countries such as Australia or the United States. Discussion and conclusions: Currently, sports betting is easy to access, normalized, and contains many attractive features for sports bettors. Psychoeducation about potential risks of sports betting and encouragement of responsible gambling strategies could help lessen risky sports-betting behaviors, though cross-cultural adaptations should be explored. © 2022 The Author(s).","addictive behaviors; cross-cultural; gambling disorder; regulations; sports betting; systematic review","adult; advertising; baseball; basketball; causality; clinical assessment; cognition; consumer; consumer protection; criminal law; fantasy; female; gambling; golf; government; human; illusion of control; intermediate risk population; Internet; leisure; low risk population; male; meta analysis; money; motivation; national security; online analysis; pathological gambling; peer review; physical activity; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; psychosocial disorder; qualitative research; race; Review; social marketing; social psychology; sport; sport betting; sporting event; systematic review; volleyball; Wyoming; high risk behavior; marketing; persuasive communication; psychology; Gambling; Humans; Marketing; Persuasive Communication; Risk-Taking; Sports",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139838051

However, there is a need for a systematic review to evaluate its effects and health benefits among college students. Objective:The present study aims to evaluate the current literature surrounding the effects of taichi on physical and psychological health among college students and identify the experimental areas for future research to establish guidelines for learning and teaching taichi in university. Methods: The literature search involved several databases (PubMed, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, Scopus, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure). Subsequent research utilised the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and PRISMA checklist. In addition, the “QualSyst” tool assessed the quality of full-text articles. Results: A total of 22 articles were analysed, out of which eight were strong, and 14 were of moderate quality. It is challenging to conduct a meta-analysis since the research contents were distributed differently. The general finding demonstrated that Taichi interventions have beneficial effects on college students. For example, the physical and psychological health benefits compared to other control groups include balance, leg strength, flexibility, cardiopulmonary functions, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, and improving attention. However, there are some uncertain parameters in a state of poor or no evidence, such as upper strength, mood, and psychoticism. Conclusion: Overall, this study shows that Taichi exercise is beneficial for college students compared to the control group. Evidence of health benefits for females is more than males. In addition, the current evidence showed that the effectiveness of taichi does not match some other sports such as Pilates, Yoga, Mindfulness courses, and even bodybuilding exercise. This research analyzed the mind-body mechanism of included studies. It revealed that it is difficult for college students, as a beginner of Taichi, to regulate an even breathing and quiet mind while maintaining low posture movements. Therefore, this study assumes that relaxation theories and approaches of Taichi that are easier to understand and closer to Chinese traditional Taichi theory are more appropriate in the research trials compared with coordination theory.

Various exercise interventions have been applied to decrease the visceral fat in young individuals with obesity. But the evidence remains controversial on the effect of the exercise on visceral fat. Moreover, it is unclear which type of the exercise is the most effective for young individuals with overweight or obesity to reduce visceral fat. Objective: The objective of this review and meta-analysis is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different exercise interventions on visceral fat in young individuals with overweight or obesity. Methods: Four databases consisting of PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library were searched prior to May 2022. Fifteen studies with a total of 30 data points involving 1,134 participants were included in this meta-analysis. And the interventions were limited to 4 exercise types [i.e., aerobic exercise (AE), resistance exercise (RE), aerobic exercise combined with resistance exercise (CE), and high-intensity interval training (HIIT)]. Data Synthesis: The results showed that AE (Standardized Mean Difference = −0.32; 95% CI = −0.50 to −0.13; p = 0.0007; I2 = 37%) and HIIT (SMD = −0.59; 95% CI = −0.87 to −0.31; p &lt; 0.0001; I2 = 0%) had a significant reduction effect on visceral fat. And the effect of HIIT seemed better than AE. However, RE (SMD = −0.58; 95% CI = −1.34 to 0.17; p = 0.13; I2 = 76%) and CE (SMD = −0.21; 95% CI = −0.81 to 0.38; p = 0.48; I2 = 63%) had a non-significant effect on visceral fat decline. Additionally, compared with the control group, exercise interventions had a significant effect on reducing visceral fat in adolescents (SMD = −0.54; 95% CI = −0.82 to −0.26; p = 0.0001; I2 = 64%) and young adults (SMD = −0.42; 95% CI = −0.69 to −0.15; p = 0.003; I2 = 0%) rather than children (SMD = −0.15; 95% CI = −0.32 to 0.02; p = 0.08; I2 = 0%). And the gender-based subgroup analysis indicated that the effectiveness of the exercise on the reduction of visceral fat was more significant in males (SMD = −1.27; 95% CI = −1.67 to −0.87; p &lt; 0.00001; I2 = 0%) than that in females (SMD = −0.31; 95% CI = −0.48 to −0.14; p = 0.0004; I2 = 0%). Conclusion: This review and meta-analysis demonstrates that exercise interventions are efficient to decrease visceral fat in adolescents (12–18 years old) and young adults (18–24 years old). Among different exercise types, AE and HIIT are helpful for young individuals with overweight or obesity to reduce visceral fat and HIIT appears to be the most effective exercise intervention. In addition, the effect of exercise interventions on the consumption of visceral fat is more significant in males than that in females.

Design Systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Data sources Four databases (PubMed, SportsDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL) were searched for data from 2012 to 2021. Eligibility criteria Studies reporting SRC incidence rates or the number of concussions and athletic exposures (AEs) per 1000 participating events or hours in healthy female contact and collision sport athletes of any age were included. Results The search yielded 8438 non-duplicate articles. Following screening, 19 were included in the analysis (median quality score=70%), with 8 reporting match or training incidence rates. Studies were primarily from US high school and collegiate populations; data are reported for eight sports. Rugby union reported the highest match SRC rates (8.2-16.11 per 1000 AE hours), followed by Gaelic football (5.21 per 1000 AE hours) and soccer (2.08-4.04 per 1000 AE events). Where available, match SRC rates were substantially higher than training and overall SRC rates. Conclusion Female sports such as rugby union, Gaelic football and soccer present the highest risk for SRCs within the available data. Previous research indicates a potentially greater injury burden for female athletes experiencing SRCs than their male counterparts. Thus, future research should analyse concussion knowledge and return-to-play protocols in these sports. Future research should also prioritise exploration of the gap in SRC rates within amateur sports, and data should be presented specifically in the context of athletic exposures (match vs training).

However, the data used in these studies are primarily multi-source and multimodal (i.e., longitudinal repeated-measures data and cross-sectional data), resulting in the models not fully utilising the information in the data to reveal specific injury risk patterns. Therefore, this study proposed an injury risk prediction model based on a multi-modal strategy and machine learning algorithms to handle multi-source data better and predict injury risk. This study retrospectively analysed the routine monitoring data of sixteen young female basketball players. These data included training load, perceived well-being status, physiological response, physical performance and lower extremity non-contact injury registration. This study partitions the original dataset based on the frequency of data collection. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was used to construct unimodal submodels to obtain decision scores for each category of indicators. Ultimately, the decision scores from each submodel were fused using the random forest (RF) to generate a lower extremity non-contact injury risk prediction model at the decision-level. The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that the fusion model was effective in classifying non-injured (mean Precision: 0.9932, mean Recall: 0.9976, mean F2-score: 0.9967), minimal lower extremity non-contact injuries risk (mean Precision: 0.9317, mean Recall: 0.9167, mean F2-score: 0.9171), and mild lower extremity non-contact injuries risk (mean Precision: 0.9000, mean Recall: 0.9000, mean F2-score: 0.9000). The model performed significantly more optimal than the submodel. Comparing the fusion model proposed with a traditional data integration scheme, the average Precision and Recall improved by 8.2 and 20.3%, respectively. The decision curves analysis showed that the proposed fusion model provided a higher net benefit to athletes with potential lower extremity non-contact injury risk. The validity, feasibility and practicality of the proposed model have been confirmed. In addition, the shapley additive explanation (SHAP) and network visualisation revealed differences in lower extremity non-contact injury risk patterns across severity levels. The model proposed in this study provided a fresh perspective on injury prevention in future research.

Athletes playing in the Turkish Deaf Basketball and Volleyball national teams and in Basketball and Volleyball First Leagues participated in the study. The study group consisted of 51 male athletes, including deaf basketball (n = 11; age: 26.18 ± 4.79 years), deaf volleyball (n = 12, age: 26.33 ± 4.27 years), non-deaf basketball (n = 14, age: 26.93 ± 4.87 years), and non-deaf volleyball (n = 14, age: 24.93 ± 5.10 years) players. As a result of the test, Jump Height from Take Off Velocity, Jump Height from Take Off Velocity, Jump Height from Flight Time, Counter Movement Acceleration, Push Off Acceleration, Average Velocity, Average Power, and Average Force were analyzed. Differences in the jump performances among the groups (deaf basketball and volleyball, non-deaf basketball, and volleyball) were tested by one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post-hoc follow-up testing when necessary for jump test. As a result, this is the first study to investigate the number of jumps and jump height, the force produced, acceleration at the time of jump, and jump velocity during 30 s in deaf and non-deaf basketball and volleyball players within the scope of individual Repeated Counter Movement Jump test. Based on the biomechanical changes according to our results, our findings show a greater decrease in the number of jumps and jump heights, the force produced, the acceleration at the moment of the jump and the jump velocity in all athletes, especially those that affect the deaf.

The sample was composed of a total of 15 matches played in the women’s U16 Eurobasket championship, in which a total of nine referees (6 men and 3 women) participated. The internal load variables analysed were heart rate and the subjective rating of perceived exertion. The external load variables were divided into kinematic and neuromuscular variables, measured using inertial devices. The results show that there are associations between the values of objective internal load and external load, as well as between the variables of external load. In contrast, there is no relation between internal subjective load and the variables of objective internal and external load, except regarding Metabolic Power.

However, there are sparse epidemiologic data regarding these injuries over the past 20 years. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, return to play (RTP) rate/length, and mechanism of knee injuries in the WNBA. We hypothesized that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears would have the highest prevalence and longest RTP times. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Publicly available WNBA injury reports were used to find WNBA athletes who sustained knee injuries. The RTP length was determined by calculating the number of days between the date of the injury and the date of the first game they played after returning. The RTP rate was determined by calculating the number of players who returned to play from each injury compared with the total number of each injury. Incidence of knee injuries, frequency, and time to RTP were calculated for each injury. Available videos were analyzed to determine the mechanism and body position at the time of injury. Results: Overall, 99 WNBA players were identified as having sustained a knee injury during the study period resulting in loss of play. ACL tears (n = 37; 37%) were the most devastating injury, resulting in the longest time before RTP (n = 375 days; 70%). The position with the highest incidence of knee injuries was guard, accounting for 53% of knee injuries. Video analysis conducted on 12 knee injuries revealed that such injuries were most commonly noncontact (83%).The mechanisms of injury were most commonly planting (58%) and landing from a jump (33%) with the knee flexed in the valgus position (100%). Conclusion: Study findings indicated that ACL tears are the most common clinically significant knee injuries sustained in the WNBA, accounting for 37% of total knee injuries with a mean RTP rate of 375 days. The most common mechanism of injury was planting the foot or landing from a jump with a flexed knee in the valgus position. Knee injuries had a high RTP rate in WNBA players but resulted in them missing a significant amount of playing time. © The Author(s) 2022.","female athletes; knee injuries; WNBA","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; athlete; basketball; body mass; body position; controlled study; contusion; female; human; incidence; interrater reliability; knee injury; major clinical study; male; prevalence; reconstructive surgery; return to sport; videorecording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138689608

Purpose: To report the epidemiology of intra- versus extra-articular hip injuries in NBA players with regard to missed games, risk factors for injury, and treatment types. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The NBA injury database was queried for all reported hip and groin injuries from 2013 to 2017. The injuries were then divided into intra-articular and extra-articular types. Variables compared between injury types included player age, NBA tenure, season schedule (preseason or offseason), onset type, injury mechanism, roster position, games missed, time to return to play, and need for surgery. Results: A total of 224 athletes sustaining 353 total hip pathologies were identified. Of these injuries, 216 (61.2%) were sustained during game competition and affected 156 (69.6%) of the athletes. Intra-articular injuries represented 39 (11.0%) cases and involved 36 (16.1%) players. The time to return to play was significantly longer after intra-articular versus extra-articular injury (44.6 ± 96.0 vs 11.8 ± 32.0 days; P =.03), and the number of games missed was significantly greater after intra-articular versus extra-articular injury (8.0 ± 18.7 vs 1.54 ± 4.9 games; P =.03). Patients with intra-articular hip injuries were more likely to undergo surgery (odds ratio, 5.5 [95% CI, 1.8-16.7]; P =.005). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of games missed due to surgery (35.2 ± 8.3 [intra-articular] vs 35.4 ± 11.6 [extra-articular]; P =.42) or nonoperative treatment (4.2 ± 3.4 [intra-articular] vs 1.3 ± 0.5 [extra-articular]; P =.11). Years of NBA tenure were not significantly different between intra-articular and extra-articular injuries (7.1 ± 3.7 vs 6.3 ± 4.0 years). For both types of hip injury, there was no correlation between player age and either days to return to play or number of games missed (R2 = 0.014). Conclusion: NBA players with intra-articular hip injuries underwent surgery more frequently and had a longer return-to-play time compared with those with extra-articular hip injuries. NBA tenure and player age were not correlated with the risk of developing hip injury or the need for surgery. © The Author(s) 2022.","basketball; FAI; FAIS; hip impingement; intra-articular hip; NBA","Article; athlete; basketball player; cohort analysis; competition; extra articular hip Injury; femoroacetabular impingement; hip disease; hip injury; human; intra articular hip Injury; National Basketball Association Player; return to sport; risk factor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138682725

The purpose of this study was to examine seasonal changes in body composition (BC), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ), as well as dietary intake of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I (DI) male basketball players. BC, RMR and RQ were assessed during pre-season, in-season, and post-season (September, December, and March) while dietary assessment data were collected in September and February. Results of this study indicated that players received inadequate energy (p < 0.0001), protein (p < 0.001) and carbohydrate (p < 0.0001) relative to the recommendations for exercising individuals during the September baseline period. However, following diet analysis and consultations and relative to recommendations, athletes received adequate amounts of energy and protein during follow-up, yet intakes of carbohydrate (p = 0.0025) were still significantly different than recommended. Results also indicated that there was a decrease in percent body fat (%BF) during season, an increase in lean body mass (LBM) from pre- to post-season, a peak in RMR during season and an increase in RQ post-season. These findings reveal that significant metabolic and body composition changes occur in players over the season and suggest that nutritional strategies employed concomitantly may be beneficial. © 2022 by the authors.","athletes; body composition (BC); collegiate basketball; dietary intake; respiratory quotient (RQ); resting metabolic rate (RMR); seasonal changes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138643610

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze achievement motivation according to four variables: students’ sex, the taught sport modality, students’ experience and teaching methodology. Likewise, the effects of students’ sex and experience on the methodologies applied were analyzed. A total of 108 primary education students (10.95 ± 0.48 years), 54 boys and 54 girls, from three state schools participated in the study. The students answered the Achievement Motivation in Physical Education test (Spanish version) after participating in soccer and basketball programs based on different methodologies. Each class-group received a different educational program (soccer or basketball). The differences between the categories of the variables analyzed were calculated for each dimension of the motivational test through the Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis H tests. The effects of students’ sex and experience on the teaching methodologies applied were analyzed using the univariate General Linear Model test. In soccer and basketball, boys perceived being more motor competent (U = 732.00; p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.43) than girls. In addition, experienced students in both sports perceived being more motor competent (U = 695.50; p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.27) than inexperienced students. In turn, they indicated feeling less failure anxiety and stress (U = 780.00; p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.22). All of the students who played soccer reported more commitment (learning dedication) (U = 1051.50; p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.20) and perceived motor competence (U = 972.00; p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.24) than students who played basketball. Considering the effects of students’ sex and experience on the methodologies (perceived motor competence dimension), there were significant differences (F = 7.68; p &lt; 0.05; ηp2 = 0.07) in favor of experienced boys who played soccer and basketball using the Tactical Games Approach methodology. Soccer was practiced more in school and out of school. This made students feel greater commitment (learning dedication) and perceived motor competence towards this invasion sport in physical education. In addition, it was shown that teachers should take into account students’ sex and experience because they are two factors that influence the teaching of sports and achievement motivation. © 2022 by the authors.","experience; perceived motor competence; primary education; sex; teaching methodology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138570857

It is hypothesised that this type of athletic history would cause an increased prevalence of neurodegenerative disease, as detected by biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease processes. Methods One hundred and fifty-nine participants were recruited (90 males, 69 females, mean age 61.3±9.13 years), including 121 participants who had retired from playing professional or semiprofessional sports and self-reported ≥1 concussion during their careers (range 1-74; mean concussions=10.7). The control group included 38 age-matched and sex-matched controls, with no history of concussion. We measured neurofilament light (NfL) and tau (neurodegeneration markers), glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocytic activation marker) and 40 and 42 amino acid-long amyloid beta (Aβ40 and Aβ42) (Alzheimer-associated amyloid pathology markers) concentrations using ultrasensitive single molecule array technology. Results We found retired athletes reporting one or more concussions throughout an athletic career showed no significant changes in NfL, tau, GFAP and Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations in comparison to a control group. No correlations were found between biomarkers and number of concussions (mean=10.7). A moderate correlation was found between NfL concentration and age. Conclusion No difference in blood concentrations of neurodegeneration markers NfL, tau, GFAP and Aβ40 and Aβ42 was found in retired athletes with a history of concussion compared with controls. An increased prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is not detected by biomarkers in a population self-reporting multiple concussions.

Key search terms were entered into five academic databases. Following a dedicated screening process and critical appraisal, data from the final articles informing this review were extracted, tabulated, and synthesised. Of 19,614 identified articles, 50 articles informed this review. Representing 16 countries, the most common populations investigated were military and firefighter populations, but a wide range of general occupations (e.g., shipping, mining, hairdressing, and healthcare workers) were represented. Footwear types included work safety boots/shoes (e.g., industrial, gumboots, steel capped, etc.), military and firefighter boots, sports shoes (trainers, tennis, basketball, etc.) and various other types (e.g., sandals, etc.). Occupational footwear was found to impact gait and angular velocities, joint ranges of motion, posture and balance, physiological measures (like aerobic capacity, heart rates, temperatures, etc.), muscle activity, and selected occupational tasks. Occupational footwear associated with injuries included boots, conventional running shoes, shoes with inserts, harder/stiffer outsoles or thin soles, and shoes with low comfort scores—although the findings were mixed. Occupational footwear was also linked to potentially causing injuries directly (e.g., musculoskeletal injuries) as well as leading to mechanisms associated with causing injuries (like tripping and slipping). © 2022 by the authors.","injury prevention; work boots; work shoes; worker health; worker safety","angular momentum; meta-analysis; physical activity; physiological response; public health; safety; skeleton; sport; aerobic capacity; ankle injury; ankle pain; ankle sprain; athlete; basketball; biomechanics; body mass; breathing rate; electromyography; energy expenditure; erector spinae muscle; ergonomics; fire fighter; foot pain; gait; gastrocnemius muscle; ground reaction force; health care personnel; heart rate; heel pain; hip pain; human; injury; knee function; knee pain; meta analysis; muscle contraction; muscle function; musculoskeletal injury; occupation; oxygen consumption; physical activity; plantar fasciitis; range of motion; Review; skin temperature; systematic review; task performance; tennis; torque; training; treadmill exercise; walking",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137592942

Although prior literature has suggested that inadequate rest may lead to an increased injury risk, the unique circumstances surrounding this season offer a unique opportunity to evaluate player safety in the setting of reduced interval rest. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the condensed 2020 NBA season resulted in an increased overall injury risk as compared with the 2015 to 2018 seasons. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A publicly available database, Pro Sports Transactions, was queried for injuries that forced players to miss ≥1 game between the 2015 and 2020 seasons. Data from the 2019 season were omitted given the abrupt suspension of the league year. All injury incidences were calculated per 1000 game-exposures (GEs). The primary outcome was the overall injury proportion ratio (IPR) between the 2020 season and previous seasons. Secondary measures included injury incidences stratified by type, severity, age, position, and minutes per game. Results: A total of 4346 injuries occurred over a 5-season span among 2572 unique player-seasons. The overall incidence of injury during the 2020 season was 48.20 per 1000 GEs but decreased to 39.97 per 1000 GEs when excluding COVID-19. Despite this exclusion, the overall injury rate in 2020 remained significantly greater (IPR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.32-1.52]) than that of the 2015 to 2018 seasons (28.20 per 1000 GEs). On closer evaluation, the most notable increases seen in the 2020 season occurred within minor injuries requiring only a 1-game absence (IPR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.37-1.70]) and in players who were aged 25 to 29 years (IPR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.40-2.63]), averaging ≥30.0 minutes per game (IPR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.47-1.90]), and playing the point guard position (IPR, 1.67 [95% 1.44-1.95]). Conclusion: Players in the condensed 2020 NBA season had a significantly higher incidence of injuries when compared with the prior 4 seasons, even when excluding COVID-19–related absences. This rise is consistent with the other congested NBA seasons of 1998 and 2011. These findings suggest that condensing the NBA schedule is associated with an increased risk to player health and safety. © The Author(s) 2022.","basketball; COVID-19; injury; National Basketball Association; NBA; player health","ankle injury; arm injury; Article; athlete; basketball; body mass; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; exposure; game exposure; hand injury; head and neck injury; health; height; hip injury; human; injury; knee injury; leg injury; pandemic; player health; player safety; position; risk factor; safety; season; shoulder injury; sport injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137416876

Several medial meniscus anomalies including anomalous insertion have been reported in the literature. This report presents a rare case of symptomatic complete discoid medial meniscus whose anterolateral (apical) portion was completely coalesced with the ACL. MRI, radiographic, and arthroscopic findings in the medial compartment are to be submitted. Case Presentation: A 29-year-old male presented with intermittent pain and swelling of the right knee for 2 years. Based on radiographic, MRI, and physical examination findings, he was diagnosed with discoid medial meniscus tears. Arthroscopic saucerization was performed for the torn discoid medial meniscus of the right knee. Arthroscopic examination revealed a complete discoid medial meniscus and the anterolateral (apical) portion of which was completely coalesced with the ACL. Careful Probing of the meniscal surface revealed there was a longitudinal tear extending from the tibial spine to the midportion of the meniscus. Arthroscopic saucerization of the discoid meniscus was performed after closely cutting the meniscus around the ACL. The patient reported no symptoms, and he had returned to his daily and sports activities, including football, basketball, and jogging, at the 12-month follow-up. Conclusion: Complete discoid medial meniscus is an extremely rare abnormality, and this case presents the third complete discoid medial meniscus whose anterolateral (apical) portion was completely coalesced with the ACL. The current case we present strongly supports the hypothesis that ACL and meniscus were differentiated from the same mesenchyme. © 2022 The Authors.

However, there is a need for a better understanding of pre-shot combinations that lead to these performance trends. This study aimed to analyze NBA teams’ game-related statistics, pre-shooting combinations, and pick-and-roll differences between winning and losing teams (considering the context: playing at home, away, or in a neutral court) during the COVID-19 season. A retrospective cross-sectional study on the 2019–2020 NBA season (906 games) was carried out. Game-related statistics were gathered from the private company InStat (https://basketball.instatscout.com/). The discriminant analysis and binary logistic regression models were run in order to discriminate the most important features of winning teams depending on the game location. The results showed that defensive rebounds and three-point shooting percentage remained the most important variables that best discriminated winners and losers independently of the game location context. The main results showed that winning teams had a better shooting percentage based on three-pointers, catch-and-shot actions, cuts, pick-and-roll efficacy, and uncontested shots based on a better collective behavior after a successful space creation dynamic through a tactical functional unit. At the same time, teams would need players with the ability to clear those possessions in which the opponents force to an isolation or a contested shot. From a practical application perspective, coaches should focus on composing a team with good shooters, skilled players in isolations, and a good game-time pick-and-roll strategy.

Design Cross-sectional analysis. Primary and secondary outcome measures We obtained video footage from the International Paralympic Committee of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games that included 8 teams from each of the 18 wheelchair rugby and 10 wheelchair basketball games (men and women). The data were analysed to evaluate the number of falls, class difference (low or high pointer), time of play during the fall, phase of play, contact with other athletes, fall direction, fall location and the body part that first contacted the floor during the fall. These data from the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 games were compared. Results Overall, 430 falls (rugby, 104; men's basketball, 230 and women's basketball, 96) occurred (average per game ±SD: 5.8±3.1, 23.0±5.4 and 9.6±5.0, respectively). Significant differences in class, direction, fall location and body part point of contact between the three sports were observed. In wheelchair rugby, falls occurred mainly in high pointers and tended to be more lateral due to contact. In wheelchair basketball, falls occurred more in female high-pointers and in male low pointers, with more forward falls due to forward contact. Unlike in the Rio 2016 games, no difference between the events based on the presence or absence of contact was observed in the Tokyo 2020 games. Conclusions The number of falls increased in Tokyo 2020 compared with Rio 2016, with no significant difference in the characteristics of falls between the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 games. Only in men's wheelchair basketball, the number of falls in low pointers significantly increased in the Tokyo 2020 games when compared with that in the Rio 2016 games. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Forty-four youth basketball players (age 15.48 ± 0.81 years, body mass 78.86 ± 12.04 kg, height 184.95 ± 6.71 cm) were randomly allocated to one of the four groups: traditional squat training (TST), 10% chains squat training (10% CST), 20% chains squat training (20% CST), and 30% chains squat training (30% CST). Training interventions were performed 2 times per week for 6 weeks, and at the week before (Pre) and after (Post) the 6-week CST program with different chain load ratio, the no-step vertical jump, standing long jump, 15 m shuttle run, 1 R M squat and 30 m sprint test were performed. A 4 (group) × 2 (time) repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVA) was calculated to show the scatter of each variable, and the Bonferroni’s post-hoc test was used for multiple comparisons, in addition the partial eta-squared (η2) was calculated as an estimate of the ES. Significant time × group interaction was noticed for the no-step vertical jump (p &lt; 0.001; η2 = 0.611), standing long jump (p &lt; 0.001; η2 = 0.490) and 1 R M squat (p &lt; 0.01; η2 = 0.333) indicating that better improvements appear in CST compared to TST. However, significant time × group interaction was noted for 15 m shuttle run (p &lt; 0.001; η2 = 0.428), in favor of TST compared to CST. In addition, the improvements in 30 m sprint were similar between all groups. In conclusion, CST with more chain load has better training effects on lower limb explosive strength and maximum strength, based on the improvement in 1 R M squat and jumping performance. Besides, compared with TST, CST with more chain load might not help to develop better velocity adaptation at higher range of movement.

Understanding training and match demands through the season can help optimize performance and reduce injury risk. This study investigated whether training and/or match demands differed between the regular season and finals, and whether these differences were dependent on player role. Average session intensity and volume and durations of relative exercise intensities (inactive, light, moderate-vigorous, maximal, supramaximal) were quantified during training sessions and matches using accelerometry in two semi-professional basketball teams (n = 23; 10 women, 13 men). Training and match demands were compared between the regular season (training: 445 observations; matches: 387 observations) and finals (training: 113 observations, matches: 75 observations) with consideration of player role (starters, in-rotation bench, out-rotation bench). During finals matches, starters received 4.4 min more playing time (p = 0.03), performed 14% more absolute maximal activity (p < 0.01) and had 8% less relative inactive time (p = 0.02) when compared to the regular season. Out-rotation bench players received 2.1 min less playing time (p < 0.01), performed 33% less absolute maximal activity (p = 0.01) and 57% less absolute supramaximal activity (p < 0.01) in finals when compared to the regular season. During finals training sessions, average training intensity was 5% higher (p = 0.02), absolute moderate-vigorous activity was 3% higher (p = 0.04), relative maximal activity was 12% higher (p < 0.01), and relative inactive time was 5% lower (p = 0.03) when compared to the regular season. These findings suggest starters need to be physically prepared for greater match demands during finals, while out-rotation bench players should supplement their training during finals with extra supramaximal activity to maintain their conditioning levels for matches.

The player uses either their dominant or non-dominant arm to block the ball landing on a common leg. Understanding how the bio-physical loads of the landing leg change as a function of the blocking arm will provide insights into potential injury risk of the lower limb. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of arm dominance on the biomechanical variables of injury risk of the lower limb, specifically the knee joint during the single-leg landing in female basketball players. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected from fourteen female basketball athletes (20.85 ± 1.35 years, 1.69 ± 0.06 m, 60.37 ± 7.75 kg), each performing three trials of a dominant arm and non-dominant block jump landing on the dominant leg. The results showed significantly higher anterior and medial ground reaction force, knee joint flexion and abduction and lateral knee force during the dominant arm landing (p < 0.05). These findings highlight potential injury risk and the need for the player to be more proficient at dominant arm block-shot landing. The player should aim to develop a larger landscape of technique to meet the demands of the game and facilitate a more effective and safer landing strategy. © 2022 Parunchaya Jamkrajang, Atipong Mongkolpichayaruk, Weerawat Limroongreungrat, Huw Wiltshire, Gareth Irwin, published by Sciendo.","anterior cruciate ligament injury; arm movement; basketball; knee joint biomechanics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138651077

The aim of this research was to examine the selected biomechanical determinants of the jump shot when shooting over opponents of different height. Nineteen elite basketball players, age 22 ± 3 years, performed three trials of 20 basketball shots in a crossover, randomised manner: over an obstacle of the height of standing reach (RH), over reach height with additional 20 cm (RH+20 cm), over reach height with additional 40 cm (RH+40 cm), and the maximum height jump shot without an obstacle (JSmax). Jump height, the ball entry angle, and shooting efficiency were measured on each trial. Jump height when shooting over RH+40 cm was significantly higher than RH+20 cm (+0.022 m, p = 0.030) and RH (+0.023 m, p = 0.029). Similarly, the ball entry angle was greater at RH+40 cm compared to RH (+7.19 °, p < 0.001) and RH+20 cm (+2.90°, p < 0.001). In contrast, shooting efficiency decreased significantly when shooting over RH+40 cm compared to RH (-10.79%, p = 0.048) and RH+20 cm (-8.95%, p = 0.015). We recorded the highest jump height (0.35 ± 0.08m, p < 0.001) and the lowest angle of entry (39.16 ± 1.19°, p < 0.001) when participants performed JSmax. Shooting over higher opponents should be prioritised in training to significantly improve shooting efficiency.

Twelve professional basketball players were monitored during twelve matches using a local positioning system. Peak physical demands were measured via total distance covered, distance covered >18 km·h-1, and the number of accelerations and decelerations >3 m·s-2 captured over 30-and 60-s rolling averages. The results showed that players were exposed to more than one high-demanding scenario in all variables and time epochs examined. Additionally, total distance covered presented the greatest number of moderate-demanding scenarios (40-80% of most demanding scenarios), whereas distance covered >18 km·h-1, and accelerations and decelerations >3 m·s-2 presented the greatest proportion of low-demanding scenarios (<40% of most demanding scenarios). Regarding positional differences, backcourt players generally experienced a higher number of scenarios than frontcourt players in most variables, especially in total distance covered. For this variable, scenarios between 20 and 70% of most demanding scenarios during the 30-s epoch (p < 0.001; ES = 0.420.78), and scenarios between 50 and 90% of most demanding scenarios during the 60-s epoch (p < 0.001; ES = 0.400.64) showed significant differences between backcourt and frontcourt players.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of BA supplementation on exercise performance and exercise-induced cell damage in female basketball players. Twenty-two female basketball players participated in a randomized, double-blind study. They ingested 6.4 g·day-1 of BA or an isocaloric placebo (dextrose) over 4 weeks. Exercise performance including aerobic (Bruce test), anaerobic (Wingate test), intermittent (Yo-Yo test) and basketball performance (countermovement jump and free throw shots) was measured before and following the intervention. Exercise measures were performed at the lab and free throw shots were undertaken on a wooden indoor basketball court. Blood samples were also collected before and after the exhaustive exercise to assess lactate concentration, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) activity. The exhaustive exercise test induced an increase in lactate concentration and MDA, CK and LDH activity (all p < 0.05). BA supplementation significantly reduced the lactate response to exhaustive exercise (p = 0.001); however, it had no significant effect on exercise-induced MDA, CK and LDH activity (all p > 0.05). Furthermore, exercise performance measures improved from pre-to post-test regardless of supplement/placebo ingestion (all p < 0.05). BA consumption over 4 weeks significantly reduced lactate accumulation following exhaustive exercise, but had no ergogenic effect in female basketball players.

Surgery may be considered if conservative treatment does not work or if a quicker and more reliable return to sports is expected. Surgery is usually performed under fluoroscopic guidance based on the premise that the proper placement of the internal fixation material can be determined on radiographic images. Patient concerns: A 16-year-old female basketball player gradually became aware of pain in the anterior aspect of her right knee during basketball, without any particular history of trauma. A computed tomography scan revealed a small bone fragment on the lateral side of the distal end of the patella. Diagnosis: Stress fracture of the patella. Interventions: Since it was difficult to determine the exact location of the bone fragment on radiographs, the surgery was performed under ultrasound guidance rather than fluoroscopy. While checking the bone fragment with ultrasound images, insertion of the guide pin, drilling, and screw fixation were performed under ultrasound guidance. Outcomes: Postoperative computed tomography showed accurate screw insertion into the bone fragment. Two months after surgery, bony fusion was confirmed, and the patient returned to her preinjury level of basketball. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided screw fixation was useful in this case in which internal fixation of fractures is difficult under fluoroscopic guidance. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

On the other hand, studies on the relationship between BLD and athletic performance have only begun to emerge in recent years. The purpose of this review article is to assemble and analyze the literature on the topic of the relationship between BLD and athletic performance. After a detailed review of the scientific databases, we analyzed 10 relevant scientific articles. BLD calculated from outcomes of vertical jumps was positively related to the ability to change direction quickly in volleyball, basketball, tennis and student population, but not in soccer. Sprint running performance does not seem to be associated with BLD, while one study suggested that a smaller BLD is associated with a more efficient start in a sprint. Apart from the associations with change in direction performance, there is little evidence to support the association between BLD and athletic performance; thus, further research is required in other sports, incorporating sport-specific performance outcomes and multiple tasks to calculate the BLD. © 2022 by the authors.","athletic performance; bilateral facilitation; bilateral index; muscle performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137542409

Few studies have already reported a positive effect of a sport vision program on elite sport teams’ visual skills; however, few studies have focused on the effect of sport vision programs on children’s visual skills. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of a sports vision program on Grade 4 and 5 female netball players’ visual skills. Girls (N = 25) with a mean age of 10.08 years (SD = 0.65) formed part of this study. A pre-test–post-test design was followed with a retention test. The eight-week sports vision program was executed twice a week for 60 min on the experimental group (n = 13). The Developmental Test of Visual–Motor Integration (VMI-4), the Wayne Saccadic Fixator (WSF) and the Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test were used to evaluate the girls’ visual skills, hand–eye coordination, visual reaction time, peripheral vision and saccadic eye movements. No statistical differences were found between the two groups before starting with the sports vision program. After intervention, significant differences between the two groups were reported, with the experimental group performing better in hand–eye coordination (p = 0.001) and reaction time (p = 0.001). Results further indicated that the experimental group experienced significant improvements (p ≤ 0.05) in motor coordination, hand–eye coordination, reaction speed and visual tracking after intervention with significant lasting effects (p ≤ 0.05). The control group performed significantly worse in reaction time (p = 0.01). A sports vision program can be recommended for Grade 4 and 5 female netball players to improve certain visual skills. © 2022 by the authors.","depth perception; hand–eye coordination; netball; ocular motor control; sports vision; visual skills","experimental study; perception; public health; sport; visual analysis; Article; child; clinical evaluation; controlled study; depth perception; Developmental Eye Movement test; exploratory research; eye hand coordination; eye movement control; eye tracking; female; human; male; motor coordination; netball player; peripheral vision; saccadic eye movement; school child; sensorimotor integration; social participation; sport; vision; Visual Motor Integration test; visual perception test; visual reaction time; visual system function; Wayne Saccadic Fixator test; basketball; eye movement; vision; Basketball; Child; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Saccades; Vision, Ocular; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137124501

However, systematic reviews related to the effectiveness of BL in university physical education are lacking. (2) Purpose: Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of BL in physical education among university students. (3) Methods: Searches were conducted in the following five databases: Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, EBSCOhost (SPORTDiscus), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and 18 articles met the inclusion criteria and were selected. The PEDro scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the selected studies and the quality of this study was fair (range 4–5). (4) Results: All reported sports included basketball (n = 6), badminton (n = 3), dance (n = 3), volleyball (n = 1), yoga (n = 1), aerobics (n = 1), Taiji (n = 1), swimming (n = 1), and tennis (n = 1). Seventeen studies described the effect of BL on students’ motor skills, and the results showed that BL had a greater effect on basic skills, but the improvement was not significant for combination techniques. There were three studies related to physical fitness. Studies have observed significant effects on lung capacity (n = 1), sit and reach (n = 1), pull-ups (n = 1), 1000 m (n = 3), and 800 m (n = 1). However, there was no significant difference in body weight (n = 1) or standing long jump (n = 1). In addition, two articles examined the impact of BL on sitting up, but the findings were the opposite. Six studies reported on exercise attitude and the results demonstrated that BL can significantly improve students’ learning attitude, target attitude, behavioral cognition, and emotional experience. However, the two articles produced different results in behavioral habits. Other results, such as satisfaction and interest in learning, were also popular topics regarding BL and were found to have improved significantly. © 2022 by the authors.","blended learning; physical education; sports",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136920120

Materials and Methods: A total of 254 athletes participated in this study. For the first purpose of the study, the group consisted of adult professional male basketball players (n = 30), elite male (n = 30) and female soccer players (n = 20), male futsal players (n = 30), elite male goalkeepers (n = 22), and professional female volleyball players (n = 20). For the second purpose, male youth goalkeepers (n = 22), youth female (n = 20) and male soccer players (n = 30), and youth male basketball players (n = 30) were compared to the adult athletes of the same sport. Asymmetries were measured utilizing a Humac Norm and Rehabilitation device. Testing included three maximal concentric flexion and extension repetitions at an angular speed of 60°/s. The differences in asymmetries were assessed using ANOVA followed by an LS means post-hoc analysis. An independent samples t-test was used to identify the differences between adult and youth players. Results: It was indicated that none of the groups demonstrated asymmetries greater than 10%, other than the elite female soccer players and female volleyball players. Significant differences were demonstrated between youth and adult soccer players (males and females), with the adult groups demonstrating increased asymmetries. Conclusions: Special consideration should be given to female soccer players and volleyball players, as soccer and volleyball practice and competition at the professional level may induce greater lower -limb asymmetries. The isokinetic parameters can be useful for planning strength and conditioning interventions in order to reduce or prevent those imbalances. Additional unilateral and bilateral jumping testing is encouraged for the verification of imbalances. © 2022 by the authors.","bilateral asymmetry; imbalance; sports; unilateral asymmetry","adolescent; adult; athlete; basketball; female; human; joint characteristics and functions; male; soccer; volleyball; Adolescent; Adult; Athletes; Basketball; Female; Humans; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Soccer; Volleyball",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136733255

Forty-eight male athletes from three sports of handball, volleyball and basketball were selected for this study and were randomly divided into four groups: differential learning (n = 12), self-control feedback (n = 12), external focus (n = 12), and control (n = 12) group. All groups followed the intervention for eight weeks with three sessions per week. Data were analyzed by means of 4 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc comparison (Bonferroni) at the significance level of p ≤ 0.05. A significant group × time interaction and the main effect of time was found for most kinetic and kinematic variables. The main effect of the group was significant only at the knee abduction angle. Differential learning and external focus of attention methods positively reduced the kinetic and kinematic variables that are considered risk factors for ACL injury. However, the effect sizes (Cohen’s d) for the changes in most of the variables were larger for the differential learning group. Tailoring the boundary conditions that are based on the manipulations created in the exercise through variability and variety of movements associated with differential learning methods rather than repeating movements could reduce the risk of ACL injury. © 2022 by the authors.","anterior cruciate ligament injury; biomechanics; motor learning strategy; variability","biomechanics; comparative study; injury; learning; risk factor; strategic approach; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; Article; athlete; attention; basketball; biomechanics; controlled study; data analysis; feedback system; human; kinematics; kinetics; learning; male; motor learning; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; risk factor; volleyball; young adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; attention; basketball; feedback system; knee; risk factor; self control; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Athletes; Attention; Basketball; Feedback; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Risk Factors; Self-Control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136657776

A structured search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and PICOS model in Medline (PubMed), Web of Science (WOS) and Cochrane databases. Groups of experiments were created according to neuromuscular power (vertical; NPV and horizontal; NPH) and endurance (E). Meta-analysis and sub-groups analysis were performed using a random effect model and pooled standardized mean differences (SMD). A random effects meta-regression was performed regressing SMD for the different sub-groups against percentage change for NPV and NPH. There was a significant positive overall effect of the multidisciplinary interventions on NPV, NPH and E. Sub-groups analysis indicate differences in the effects of the interventions on NPV and NPH considering age, gender, competitive level and the type of the intervention used. Considering the current data available, the meta-regression analysis suggests a good predictability of U-16 and plyometric training on jump performance.

This testing system will provide helpful information for players who intend to pursue a professional tennis career. The experimental subjects were 18 college students consisting of 10 tennis players (including 4 soft tennis) and 8 basketball players (all males). The subjects were tested on their vertical jump, 60 m shuttle runs, and shoulder joint mobility to identify tennis talent. To statistically analyze the data, an R package was used to conduct a principal component analysis of the athletic performance indicators of the samples, and the samples were further classified via agglomerative hierarchical clustering. This study found that tennis players required more flexibility than basketball players. Regarding the differences between male and female soft tennis players, the unclassified results showed that there was a significant difference in explosive power.

In this study, we examined the prevalence of preseason MSK pain in apparently healthy collegiate soccer and basketball players and its relationship with previous injuries (1-year history), among other factors. Ninety-seven eligible student athletes (mean age: 20.1 (SD: 1.6) years; 43% male; 53% soccer players) completed a baseline questionnaire comprising questions related to demographics, medical and 1-year injury history and any current MSK pain and the corresponding body location. The overall prevalence of preseason MSK pain was 26% (95% CI: 17–36%) and it did not differ by sex or sport. The back (6.2%) and knee (5.2%) regions were reported to be the most frequently affected body parts for preseason MSK pain. Athletes with a previous injury and with perception of incomplete healing had 3.5-fold higher odds (OR: 3.50; 95% CI: 1.28–9.36) of baseline MSK pain compared with those without a previous injury. One in four collegiate soccer and basketball players had preseason MSK pain. Collegiate sports medicine professionals should consider conducting routine preseason evaluations of MSK pain in their athletes and initiate appropriate interventions for the prevention of MSK pain and its potential consequences among athletes. © 2022 by the authors.","collegiate sport; injury prevention; pain; recurrent injury","bone; factor analysis; injury; muscle; physical activity; public health; skeleton; sport; student; adult; Article; backache; basketball player; controlled study; disease association; female; healing; human; human experiment; inguinal pain; knee pain; male; medical history; musculoskeletal pain; myalgia; normal human; perception; prevalence; quadriceps pain; soccer player; student athlete; young adult; athlete; basketball; injury; musculoskeletal pain; prevalence; soccer; sport injury; student; Adult; Athletes; Athletic Injuries; Basketball; Female; Humans; Male; Musculoskeletal Pain; Prevalence; Soccer; Students; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135371291

Methods: A retrospective, single-surgeon review was performed including all ACLR with hamstring autograft in pediatric and adolescent patients from 2011 to 2019. Minimum 2-year follow-up was required for patients unless a tear or reoperation was sustained before that time point. Data collected included demographics and baseline surgical variables, type of reconstruction, sporting activity, and deviations from rehabilitation protocols. Comparisons were made among hamstring autograft reconstruction groups (adult-type/anatomic, transphyseal, and partial transphyseal) for primary outcomes of graft tear, contralateral ACL tears, and all-cause ipsilateral knee reoperations, including hardware removal. Secondary surgeries performed with different surgeons were noted. Results: In total, 214 patients of age 15.2 ± 2.0 years with 4.1 ± 1.7-year follow-up were included. Overall graft tear rate was 11.7% (11.0% adult-type vs 19.1% transphyseal vs 5.6% partial transphyseal; P = .18). On univariate analyses, all-cause ipsilateral reoperation did not differ by technique (21.3% vs 31.0% vs 33.3%; P = .20), and neither did contralateral ACL tear (8.1% vs 9.5% vs 0%; P = .17). 21.7% of ipsilateral revision ACLRs (all adult-type) and 16.7% of patients with any reoperations had subsequent procedures performed with a different surgeon. Conclusions: The graft tear rates in primary hamstring autograft ACLRs in the adolescent population did not significantly differ by technique (11.0% vs 19.1% vs 5.6% in adult-type, transphyseal, and partial transphyseal reconstructions, respectively). Furthermore, contralateral ACL tears (8.1% vs 9.5% vs 0%) and all-cause (including > 1/4 hardware removal) ipsilateral knee reoperations (21.3% vs 31.0% vs 33.3%) did not statistically differ.

Methods: This work is a descriptive epidemiology study. A total of 302 cases of AT rupture admitted to our department between 01/2013 and 02/2020 are analyzed according to telephone follow-up and medical records. Male to female ratio is 10.3 and the average age is 37.5 years. The record of each case includes age, gender, Body mass index (BMI), quinolone use, corticoid exposure and related medical history/comorbidities. If the case is sports-related (SR), details including kind of sports, intensity of exercise, exercise time before rupture, specific action that causes rupture and situation of warm-up are collected. Two independent sample t-tests and Pearson chi-square tests are used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 252 ruptures are SR. Male to female ratio is 15.6 in SR cases. Most SR ruptures occur in patients aged 25–39 years. Ball games are major sports responsible for rupture: basketball in 95 (37.7%), badminton in 68 (27.0%) and soccer in 62 (24.6%). Acceleration and running start is the specific action that cause most (37.7%) ruptures. AT cases are observed in 91 patients with warm-up and 161 without preparation before exercise. As a result, more ruptures happened within 10 min' sports in 161 unprepared (22.4%) than in 91 prepared (5.5%) cases. In SR cases, 107 and 145 cases are observed on weekends and weekdays. Of the 302 total cases, 64 are associated with Achilles tendinopathy. Frequently reported factors such as quinolone use and corticoid exposure are found only in two and 11 of all cases, respectively. Conclusion: Middle-aged males are common victims of AT rupture in Shanghai. Sports including basketball, badminton, soccer and actions involving in sudden and severe contraction of AT cause most ruptures. Warm-up before exercise reduces rupture in short time. Factors such as quinolone, corticoid and Achilles tendonitis still need attention. © 2022 The Authors.

However, previous studies focused predominantly on the associations of the total amount of physical activity with CVD. There were few evidences on the associations of specific sport disciplines with CVD. Furthermore, little was known on the interactions between the different types of sports on CVD risk. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the independent associations of specific types of physical activities with the 10-year risk of CVD, and further evaluate the interactions between specific types of physical activities on the 10-year risk of CVD in US adults. Methods: This study used the data of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006. Participants aged ≥ 30 years and with free of CVD were eligible. The physical activity questionnaire is used to collect general information on leisure-time activities in the past 30 days, including the frequency, duration, and intensity of participation in each activity. The exposures of interest included cycling, swimming, aerobics, running, American Football, basketball, and racquet sports. The Framingham risk score algorithm was used to assess 10-year CVD risk based on age, high density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, and diabetes. A higher total score reflects a greater risk of CVD. Results: This study included 10829 participants. Compared to no participation, participation in cycling (β = −0.890, 95% CI:−1.278,−0.502, P < 0.001), running (β = −1.466, 95% CI:−1.837,−1.095, P < 0.001), American Football (β = −2.934, 95% CI:−3.750,−2.119, P < 0.001), basketball (β = −1.968, 95% CI:−2.645,−1.291, P < 0.001), and aerobics (β = −0.980, 95% CI:−1.352,−0.608, P < 0.001) was associated with a lower CVD risk. Furthermore, cycling was antagonistic with basketball and racquet sports in the associations with CVD risk. An antagonistic action between swimming and aerobics was also observed. Nevertheless, running was synergistic with cycling, aerobics, and racquet sports in the associations with CVD risk. Conclusions: There were inverse associations of specific types of physical activities with CVD risk. Furthermore, there might be synergistic and antagonistic associations of multiple types of physical activities with CVD risk.

A total of 40 boys recruited from a local after-school basketball training club were divided into a low-frequency group (once a week) and a high-frequency group (at least twice a week). An additional 20 age-matched boys recruited from a local elementary school were considered as the control group (no training experience). All subjects conducted the Stop-signal task, the N-back task, and the switching task at rest. The mean reaction time and accuracy data obtained from each task were used in statistical analysis. There was no significant group difference in either the accuracy or reaction time of inhibitory control. Meanwhile, no significant difference was found in the reaction time of working memory across groups. However, the high-frequency group exhibited significantly higher accuracy (93.00 ± 4.31%) with regard to working memory than the low-frequency group (85.4 ± 6.04%, P < 0.001) and the control group (83.73 ± 7.70%, P < 0.001), respectively. A positive correlation was also found between the accuracy of working memory and groups. Furthermore, in comparison with the control group, the high-frequency group exhibited significantly higher cognitive flexibility accuracy (91.93 ± 7.40% vs. 85.70 ± 9.75%, P = 0.004) and shorter reaction time (934.24 ± 213.02 ms vs. 1,122.06 ± 299.14 ms, P < 0.001). There was also a positive correlation between the accuracy of cognitive flexibility and groups. These findings suggest that regular basketball training, especially with higher frequency, is beneficial to working memory and cognitive flexibilityin boys aged 6 to 8.

We aim to validate PSL-derived markers in characterizing LV function in pre-adolescent basketball players by comparing results before and after the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) and explore its association with CPX-derived aerobic capacity. Methods: Cardiac morphology and function in 20 pre-adolescent basketball players were assessed at 9.7 years old (9.7 ± 1.1 year) before and after cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Echocardiography was performed in all subjects, including two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE). Simultaneous brachial-cuff-measured blood pressure was recorded to perform PSL analysis. Results: Nineteen subjects were included in the final analysis. Exercise training in pre-adolescent males was associated with lower global work index (GWI) and global work efficiency (GWE) at rest. GWE at stress was significantly correlated with VO2max and peak O2 pulse (p = 0.0122, r = 0.56; p = 0.00122, r = 0.69, respectively). When indexed by body mass, GWI and GWE both significantly correlated with relative VO2max (p = 0.0086 and 0.0011 respectively, r = 0.58 and 0.69 respectively); GWI and GWE at baseline and stress were all significantly correlated with peak O2 pulse (GWI at baseline, p &lt; 0.0001, r = −0.90; GWE at baseline, p &lt; 0.0001, r = −0.89; GWI at stress, p = 0.0289, r = −0.50; GWE at stress, p &lt; 0.0001, r = −0.83).

Jumping and landing movement patterns are potential risk factors for patellar tendinopathy. Hypothesis: Male college basketball players who developed patellar tendinopathy would demonstrate greater peak vertical ground reaction force and knee flexion angular velocity, and smaller knee flexion range of motion and knee flexion angles at initial contact compared to players who did not develop the injury when performing a stop-jump task within a year prior to the onset of the injury. Study Design: Prospective study. Methods: Freshmen college basketball male players (n = 181) were recruited for three consecutive years and followed to the end of the third year of the study. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data during a stop-jump task were collected for all participants at the beginning of each school year. Peak vertical ground reaction force, knee flexion angle at initial foot contact with the ground, range of motion for knee flexion and maximal knee flexion angular velocity during the landing phases of the stop-jump task were collected and calculated. Development of patellar tendinopathy was monitored in follow-up. Independent t-tests and Cohen's d effect sizes (ES) were used to compare movement patterns between injury and no injury groups for each school year. Results: A total of 60 knees developed patellar tendinopathy. The injury groups had a significantly greater peak vertical ground reaction force in freshmen and junior years (P = 0.020, ES = 0.13; P = 0.046, ES = 0.17), smaller knee flexion ROM in freshmen year (P = 0.002, ES = 0.10), and greater maximum knee flexion angular velocity in freshmen and junior year (P = 0.012, ES = 0.10; P = 0.001, ES = 0.35) during the horizontal landing phase before the takeoff of the jump compared to the no injury groups. The injury groups also had a significantly smaller knee flexion angle at initial contact during vertical landing phase after the takeoff of the jump in freshmen and junior years (P = 0.001, ES = 0.36; P = 0.001; ES = 0.37) during vertical landing phase. Conclusion: Peak vertical ground reaction force, knee flexion angle at initial foot contact, knee flexion range of motion, and maximum knee flexion angular velocity are associated with patellar tendinopathy among male college basketball players in different school years.

Within the analyzed variables, distance covered at different speed zones is one of the most studied. However, there is no consensus in the definition of speed zones in the published articles about each team sport, so it makes difficult a comparison between them. Therefore, the purposes of this article were to establish a criteria standard in the classification of speed zones in team sports and to analyze its practical application in basketball. Five speed categories were established for basketball following the methodology described above: 0-10km/h, >10-13.8 km/h, >13.8-17.6 km/h, >17.6-21.5 km/h, and >21.5 km/h. The results showed differences between periods in high-speed displacements and sprints, maximum speed, total decelerations, and accelerations. In conclusion, the categorization of workload based on standard deviation according to maximum speed could be a viable option to individualize the analysis of distance covered per speeds in team sports such as basketball. Its use may lead to a better understanding and contextualization of the locomotion data in specific sports and teams. © 2022 Kassel University Press GmbH.

Participants took eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich fish oil supplements over two menstrual cycles. Materials and Methods: For this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 21 female members of a university basketball team were selected. Participants were allocated into the EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) group (EG, n = 11) and control group (CG, n = 10) through stratified randomization. The EG and CG took 3600 mg fish oil (containing 900 mg EPA and 403 mg DHA) and 3600 mg corn oil (without EPA and DHA), respectively, every day for two menstrual cycles. The redox reaction was measured four times: the menstrual and follicular phases in two menstrual cycles. Results: There was a significant difference in reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) and potential antioxidant capacity during the menstrual phase by the main effect of time (before and after intake) in EG and CG (p < 0.01). In a subsequent test, d-ROMs were significantly lower after intake in EG and CG (p < 0.05); however, no significant difference in potential antioxidant capacity was found. A significant difference was noted in d-ROMs and potential antioxidant capacity during the follicular phase by the effect of time (before and after intake) only in EG (p < 0.01). Significant decreases in d-ROMs and increases in potential antioxidant capacities were observed after intake (p < 0.05).

Purpose: To evaluate the incidence and impact of concussion injuries occurring in the WNBA. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Publicly available records were searched to identify all documented basketball-related concussions from WNBA seasons 1997 to 2020. Player demographics, injury details, and basketball career information were collected. Concussion incidence and return-to-play (RTP) timing were evaluated before and after the institution of the WNBA concussion protocol in 2012. Minutes per game and game score per minute were compared 5 games before and 5 games after the concussion was sustained. Player game availability and RTP performance were also compared with an age-, body mass index–, position-, and experience-matched control group of players who did not sustain any injuries during the index season. Results: A total of 70 concussions among 55 players were reported in the WNBA from 1997 to 2020, with a mean incidence of 2.9 ± 2.3 concussions per season. After the implementation of the WNBA concussion protocol, the incidence significantly increased from 1.7 to 5.0 concussions per season (P <.001). All players returned after a first-time concussion, missing a mean of 3.8 ± 4.7 games and 17.9 ± 20.7 days. After the adoption of the concussion protocol, the time to RTP significantly increased with games missed (P =.006) and days missed (P =.006). Minutes per game and game score per minute were not significantly affected by sustaining a concussion (P =.451 and P =.826, respectively). Conclusion: Since the adoption of the WNBA concussion protocol in the 2012 season, the incidence of concussions increased significantly. Athletes retained a high rate of RTP after missing a median of 4 games, and the time to RTP increased after the institution of the concussion protocol. Player game availability and performance within the same season were not significantly affected by concussion injuries after a successful RTP. © The Author(s) 2022.","basketball; concussion; performance; return to sport; Women’s National Basketball Association","adult; Article; athlete; athletic performance; basketball; body mass; concussion; controlled study; descriptive research; female; human; incidence; injury; retrospective study; return to sport; sport; sport injury; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135033578

Efforts to quantify injury probability utilizing machine learning have been met with renewed interest, and the development of effective models has the potential to supplement the decision-making process of team physicians. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize the epidemiology of time-loss lower extremity muscle strains (LEMSs) in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1999 to 2019 and (2) determine the validity of a machine-learning model in predicting injury risk. It was hypothesized that time-loss LEMSs would be infrequent in this cohort and that a machine-learning model would outperform conventional methods in the prediction of injury risk. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Performance data and rates of the 4 major muscle strain injury types (hamstring, quadriceps, calf, and groin) were compiled from the 1999 to 2019 NBA seasons. Injuries included all publicly reported injuries that resulted in lost playing time. Models to predict the occurrence of a LEMS were generated using random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural network, support vector machines, elastic net penalized logistic regression, and generalized logistic regression. Performance was compared utilizing discrimination, calibration, decision curve analysis, and the Brier score. Results: A total of 736 LEMSs resulting in lost playing time occurred among 2103 athletes. Important variables for predicting LEMS included previous number of lower extremity injuries; age; recent history of injuries to the ankle, hamstring, or groin; and recent history of concussion as well as 3-point attempt rate and free throw attempt rate. The XGBoost machine achieved the best performance based on discrimination assessed via internal validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.840), calibration, and decision curve analysis. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost outperformed logistic regression in the prediction of a LEMS that will result in lost time. Several variables increased the risk of LEMS, including a history of various lower extremity injuries, recent concussion, and total number of previous injuries. © The Author(s) 2022.","loss of playing time; lower extremity; machine learning; muscle strain; professional athletes","absenteeism; adult; ankle injury; area under the curve; Article; artificial neural network; basketball player; case control study; concussion; controlled study; elastic net penalized logistic regression; extreme gradient boosting; groin injury; hamstring muscle injury; human; incidence; injury; learning algorithm; leg injury; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; medical history; muscle strain; prediction; predictive model; quadriceps muscle injury; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; sports organization; support vector machine; validation process; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134947734

There is a lack of similar research in collegiate athletics. Purpose: To identify the 100 most-cited research publications related to collegiate athletics. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The Clarivate Analytics Web of Knowledge database was used to generate a list of articles relating to collegiate athletics on January 24, 2022. Articles were filtered by the total number of citations, and the 100 most-cited articles were selected. For each article, we identified and analyzed the following: author name, publication year, country of origin, journal name, article type, main research topic area, competitive level, sex of study population, and level of evidence. Results: Of the top 100 most-cited articles, 63 were related to medicine. In total, 96% of articles were published in the United States, and 80% were published in the year 2000 or later. Of the top 100 articles, 85 were observational; only 5 were experimental. The sport most represented was soccer, followed by football, baseball, and basketball.

A secondary aim was to analyze the effects of playing time on the internal demands (average and peak). Methods: Twenty-two professional basketball players were monitored during 11 games. The following internal workload variables were recorded as averages (i.e., value per minute considering the entire game) and peak values (i.e., greatest 1-minute window): 1) average Heart Rate (HR), peak HR, average Respiration Rate (RR), peak RR, average Ventilation (VE), peak VE, average VO2 and peak VO2. Results: Significantly higher peak values (very large effect size) for all internal variables were evident when compared to their average demand. Concerning playing time comparison, significantly greater average values were reached for large playing time group (24.54 ± 3.23 min) for all variables compared to small playing time group (14.13 ± 3.78 min). However, non-significant differences were apparent between large playing time and small playing time group at their internal PD. Conclusions: Understanding internal load demands using averages values drastically underestimates the internal peak values of games. Thus, 14 minutes of total playing time (1.5 quarters; ~37% of a game) is enough to expose to the players to internal peak demands. © 2022 Revista Internacional de Ciencias del Deporte.

The following internal workload variables were recorded as averages (i.e., value per minute considering the entire game) and peak values (i.e., greatest 1-minute window): 1) average Heart Rate (HR), peak HR, average Respiration Rate (RR), peak RR, average Ventilation (VE), peak VE, average VO2 and peak VO2. Results: Significantly higher peak values (very large effect size) for all internal variables were evident when compared to their average demand. Concerning playing time comparison, significantly greater average values were reached for large playing time group (24.54 ± 3.23 min) for all variables compared to small playing time group (14.13 ± 3.78 min). However, non-significant differences were apparent between large playing time and small playing time group at their internal PD. Conclusions: Understanding internal load demands using averages values drastically underestimates the internal peak values of games. Thus, 14 minutes of total playing time (1.5 quarters; ~37% of a game) is enough to expose to the players to internal peak demands. © 2022 Revista Internacional de Ciencias del Deporte.

Although the strength model of self-control explains the processes underlying MF and the model of mindfulness and de-automatization explains how mindfulness training promotes adaptive self-regulation leading to the recovery of MF, a systematic overview detailing the effects of MBI on the recovery of MF is still lacking. Thus, this systematic review aims to discuss the influences of MBI on the recovery of MF. Methods: We used five databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, Scopus, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for articles published up to 24 September 2021, using a combination of keywords related to MBI and MF. Results: Eight articles fulfilled all the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. The MBI directly attenuated MF and positively affected the recovery of psychology (attention, aggression and mind-wandering) and sports performance (handgrip, plank exercise and basketball free throw) under MF. However, the interaction did not reach statistical significance for the plank exercise. Therefore, the experience and duration of mindfulness are necessary factors for the success of MBI. Conclusions: mindfulness appears to be most related to a reduction in MF. Future research should focus on improving the methodological rigor of MBI to confirm these results and on identifying facets of mindfulness that are most effective for attenuating MF. © 2022 by the authors.

A total of 12 female basketball players participated in this cross-sectional study. Girls had a mean age of 14 (1.41) years old and a mean experience of 4 (0.85) years practicing basketball. The precompetitive anxiety and the HRV was assessed the week before and immediately before and after the match. Results showed a significant reduction (p-value < 0.05) of the several HRV variables after the match compared to baseline and pre-competition measures. However, differences between baseline and pre-competition were not found. Furthermore, a significant increase in somatic anxiety after the competition was reported. Taking into account HRV, somatic anxiety, and cognitive anxiety results, young female basketball players did not exhibit an increase in pre-competition anxiety. HRV measurements before competition can help coaches and physical trainers to identify female players with higher pre-competitive anxiety and propose intervention to manage it. Future studies should investigate the impact of coaches and parents on the pre-competitive anxiety of female and male basketball players. © 2022 by the authors.

Sporting activity is a health-promoting behavior choice and a chance to achieve the best possible sports results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the intensity of health behaviors in people practicing wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby and para-rowing. The study encompassed 176 athletes with disabilities, aged 19 to 49 (mean age 34.41 ± 8.56), from all over Poland. Men accounted for 83.5% of the respondents. They all had a significant degree of disability and used wheelchairs in their daily lives. The authors used Juczyński’s Health Behavior Inventory (HBI) and the authors’ own survey questionnaire. Nonparametric tests were used. A greater intensity of health behaviors in general (HBI—point score) and in four categories (correct eating habits—CEH, preventive behaviors—PB, positive mental attitude—PMA, health practices—HP) was observed in rugby and basketball players (compared with para-rowers). Disabled rowers achieved the poorest results. Polish Champions scored better results in preventive behaviors (PB) and weaker results in positive mental attitude (PMA)compared with those practicing amateur sport. Respondents who trained every day and had the longest weekly exercise time (>360 min) achieved the highest results in HBI in general and in all categories compared with those who trained once a week for less than 120 min a week. Respondents with higher education, those in a better financial situation, those who were employed and married, and those who were rural residents displayed a greater intensity of health-related behaviors. People in a more difficult financial situation, who had less education, who were cohabiting, and who lived on only a pension presented more preventive behaviors. There is a need for systemic health education aimed at people with disabilities who practice various sports disciplines. © 2022 by the authors.

After a short time, matches were played in Europe, in Paris (1893) and London (1894). The first demonstrational game in Poland was played by women in 1909, in Lviv. The discipline spread throughout Europe after World War I. In the 1920s, some state and international organizations were established to standardize the rules of the game. They allowed to play the first national championships and afterwards to organize interstate matches. In 1935, the First European Men’s Basketball Championship was organized, and three years later, women made their debut in the competition of this rank. Between 1938 and 2021, there were thirty-eight editions of the championships, in which the Polish national team participated twenty-nine times. Most medals were won by athletes from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Czechoslovakia, France, Bulgaria, and Spain.

During this period participants of the two groups practiced the same number of free throws in their training sessions; participants of the experimental group practiced using self-talk and developed personal free throw self-talk plans. In the final assessment, the participants repeated the free throw test following a typical shuttle run task causing increased physical exertion. The results showed that in the final assessment the self-talk group performed significantly better than the control group.

The aim of this study was to examine whether the direction of travel-related jet lag is associated with performance in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and if so, to explore potential mechanisms. Methods: Ten seasons comprising of 11,481 games of NBA data from the 2011/2012 to the 2020/2021 regular season were analyzed using multi-level mixed models with one fixed factor (three levels; jet lag direction: eastward vs westward vs no jet lag) and three random factors (team, opponent, game time). Predicted circadian resynchronization rate was accounted for, and home and away games were analysed separately. Mediation analyses were performed to examine potential mechanisms. Results: Among home teams, eastward (but not westward) jet lag was associated with reduced winning (Δ (i.e., change) = −6.03%, p = 0.051, marginal), points differential (Δ = −1.29 points, p = 0.015), rebound differential (Δ = −1.29 rebounds, p < 0.0001), and effective field goal percentage differential (Δ = −1.2%, p < 0.01). As the magnitude of eastward jet lag increased, home team points differential decreased (2 h Δ = −4.53 points, p < 0.05; 1 h Δ = −0.72 points, p = 0.07). No significant associations were found between jet lag and away team performance. Conclusion: Eastward jet lag was associated with impaired performance for home (but not away) teams. Sleep and circadian disruption associated with advancing phase following eastward travel may have significant adverse consequences on performance in the NBA, particularly when recovery time is limited. Sports organisations could consider chronobiology-informed scheduling and interventions to maximise recovery and performance of their athletes.

Participants mentioned lack of devices and facilities (51%), excessive cost (51%), lack of time (27%), players’ negative perception (25%) and lack of sufficient evidence (16%) as barriers to the implementation of recovery strategies. The present findings reveal that some dissociation between scientific evidence and perceived effectiveness was present among the study participants. A possible solution would be to ensure that scientific evidence-based guidelines are followed when considering the application of recovery strategies. Regarding actual use, participants favored easily implementable strategies (e.g. active recovery, stretching), rather than evidence-supported, but expensive and/or impractical strategies (e.g. whole-body cryotherapy). Possible solutions may include the use of practical tools that don’t need specific facilities, the development and validation of new low-cost recovery devices, the promotion of players education regarding recovery strategies, and conducting further research to increase the scientific knowledge in the area.

Methods: The data in this study were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. We collected studies in the literature using prominent academic and scientific databases such as Ebscohost, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Only 16 of the 119 studies met all of the inclusion criteria, and were thus included in the systematic review. Each study’s quality was determined using the PEDro scale. The scoring of 16 studies ranges from 2 to 5. Results: Core training could potentially improve skill performance among football, handball, basketball, swimming, dancing, Karate, Muay Thai, gymnasts, volleyball, badminton, and golf players. Conclusion: Compared with the traditional training methods, core training is a new strength training method. Strong core muscles function as hubs in the biological motor chain, which create a fulcrum for the four limbs’ strength and establish a channel for the cohesion, transmission, and integration of the upper and lower limbs. In other words, core training optimizes the transfer and overall control of motion and force to the terminal segment within athletic actions. Meanwhile, core training could increase stability and stiffness in the spine to reduce unrequired “energy leaks” and torso movement during the exertion of external loads. This mechanism could help athletes achieve better skill performance. Therefore, this review suggests that core training should be considered integrated into athletes’ daily training routines.

Nevertheless, there is no consensus about the types of sports, especially at professional levels. Non-impact sports such as swimming may have a negative effect or no effect. Objectives: Thus, the present study aimed to compare the effect of different sports on bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) of elite female athletes. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study consisting of 48 athletes in five groups of long-distance running, volleyball, basketball, swimming (n = 12 for each), and ten control subjects. For measuring the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and proximal femur (femoral neck, trochanter, and Ward’s triangle), the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) method was applied. Results: Indicated that the running, basketball, and volleyball groups had a significantly higher lumbar spine and proximal femur BMD than the swimming and control groups (P < 0.05). Running resulted in significantly higher lumbar spine BMC compared to volleyball, basketball, swimming, and control groups, respectively (P < 0.01), while basketball had higher proximal femur BMC than running and controls (P < 0.01). The Z-score of the lumbar spine in the running was significantly higher than in basketball, swimming, and controls (P < 0.05), while basketball had a significantly higher femur neck Z-score than volleyball, running, and controls (P < 0.001). Finally, the swimmers had significantly higher Z-scores in the lumbar and the proximal femur than non-athletes (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although all sports are effective for improving the bone health, the swimmers had much better bone status than non-athletes, while the sports of long-distance running and basketball were more efficient than others; therefore, a combination of endurance and jumping exercises seems to be the best way to prevent osteoporosis. © 2022, Author(s).","Bone Mineral Content; Bone Mineral Density; Elite Female Athletes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135480017

Here, we present the anthropometric profiles of athletes of the Italian national teams, who represented Italy in the 2019-2020 competitive season in the following sports: artistic (n=4) and rhythmic (n=12) gymnastics; distance swimming (speciality: 100 m freestyle) (n=14); synchronized swimming (n=10); and basketball (n=6). We also consider a group of sedentary women (n=22) for comparisons. The following anthropometric measurements were taken for each woman: stature; anterior trunk height (i.e., suprasternal-symphysion distance); chest circumference passing through the mesosternal point; biacromial diameter (i.e., akromion-akromion distance); wrist circumference; abdominal circumference passing through the omphalion and the lumbale; hip circumference; height of lower limb (i.e., epitrochanter-planta distance). Height was a selective factor in both basketball, which requires tall athletes, and artistic gymnastics, where in contrast, well-muscled athletes of small stature are required. In aquatic sports, the constitutional habitus is characterized by good development of the upper body compared to the lower limbs. The selection of elite athletes takes place primarily through anthropometric analyses, although other functional and psychological factors also influence their sports performance. © 2022, Universidad de la Frontera.

There seems to be a relationship between maximal strength (MSt) and jumping performance in general, but influence of MSt in the plantar flexors and jumping performance seems not to be investigated very well. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of MSt in the plantar flexors on jumping performance. 37 young elite basketball players were included (age: 13.9±1.8 years; weight: 66.4±16.8 kg; height: 179.21±13.24 cm) and countermovement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) height as well as unilateral and bilateral maximal isometric contraction in the plantar flexors with bended knee joint were assessed. Pearson correlations were calculated for MSt and jumping performance and Bland-Altman Analysis was performed to determine the level of variance between bilateral MSt assessment and cumulated MSt value of unilateral measurements. This study shows a moderate influence of isometric MSt in the calf muscle on jumping performance, so it seems beneficial to include the training of the plantar flexors in the training routine of basketball players. When determining MSt, the bilateral force deficit must be considered, even though there was no influence on determined correlations. © 2022 Montenegrin Sports Academy.

Physical education teachers and coaches often face the problem of how to convey information to novice learners, particularly to children. The present study aims to examine how visual and verbal analogy learning affects basketball free-throw learning as well as working memory in 9-to 12-year-old children. Material and Methods. Forty-eight children (24 males, mean age: 10.5 ± 1.8 years) were selected through convenience sampling and randomly assigned to four groups, namely visual analogy, verbal analogy, explicit, and control groups. The task involved throwing a basketball from a distance of 3.05 meters. The participants completed 15 trials in the pretest, posttest, and retention phases and 720 trials in the acquisition phase. Results. The result of the paired sample t-test indicated that the visual analogy, verbal analogy, and explicit learning groups experienced a significant improvement in their performance through the skill acquisition phase as well as an improvement in their working memories (p ≤ 0.05), while the control group did not exhibit such improvements (p = 0.91). In addition, one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that the analogy learning group outperformed other groups in both post-test and retention tests as well as in terms of motor learning and working memory (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusions. The verbal analogy and the explicit learning groups were equally better than the control group. The findings of this study suggest that coaches in instructional environments should make further use of the advantages of visual analogy learning for children. © 2022 Fatemeh Ramezani et al., published by Sciendo.","Analogy learning; Children; Explicit learning; Motor learning; Working memory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134016508

Since basketball involves sudden and intense changes in the movement direction, high frequencies of initiating dribbling and movement in posture, stoppings, and physical contact allowed by game rules, there is a link between the abilities needed for successful basketball playing and playing positions. This research aimed to determine the differences in motoric abilities, i.e. the change of direction speed, explosive strength, and running speed of basketball players who compete in different ranks of the competition in relation to the playing positions. The sample of 25 basketball players was divided into two subsamples in relation to the rank of the competition (elite and sub-elite). Eleven motoric ability tests were used in the study (change of direction speed – four tests, explosive strength – four tests, and running speed – three tests). Applying the analysis of variance (ANOVA and MANOVA), differences in motoric abilities were determined between basketball players of different ranks of a competition in relation to the playing positions in the team. Based on the results, a conclusion was reached that the players differ in favor of a higher rank of a competition in the tested abilities, namely those ones who play in the forward position. It can be inferred that a higher rank of a competition requires better quality preparation and players who differ in tactical thinking and better performance of measured abilities. © 2022 Montenegrin Sports Academy.

The monitoring of the effectiveness of pre-season training is based on a variety of biochemical and physiological indices; however, it is still unclear how pre-season training affects those markers. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the effects of pre-season training on biochemical and physiological markers. A search was performed in five large scientific databases (Pubmed (Medline), Scopus, Science-Direct, Sport-Discus (EBSCO), Semantic Scholar) and produced 7081 results, which after removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulted in 28 published scientific articles being included in this review. The most important findings suggested that the majority of the studies used a 6-or an 8-week pre-season training protocol, because these protocols have shown significant positive effects over the years. In addition, the plyometric training protocols that were used by many studies have been found to be beneficial for basketball athletes for many physiological parameters.

However, there have been reports that high-dosage pamidronate therapy induces osteopetrosis in the borders of bones. A 10-year-old boy undergoing long-term treatment with oral alendronate developed frequent fractures throughout adolescence while playing basketball. Radiographs showed osteosclerotic bands on the metaphyses of his long bones and vertebrae, and fractures were evident in the regions surrounding the osteosclerotic lesions: a stress fracture in the fourth metatarsal, anterior limbus vertebra (T12), spondylolysis (L3 and L5), and osteochondritis dissecans of the left lateral femoral condyle. Alendronate had been taken for a period of 6 years when the treatment was discontinued. Approximately 18 months after discontinuation, sclerotic bands remained evident; however, 4 years after discontinuation, sclerotic banding still surrounded the wing of the ilium but appeared diminished in the knees. In children and adolescents who engage in sports activities and are being treated with steroids and bisphosphonates, the possibility of pathological stress fractures should be considered. © 2022 The Authors","Frequent fracture; Oral bisphosphonate; Pediatric; Sclerotic band; Steroid-induced osteoporosis","alendronic acid; bisphosphonic acid derivative; corticosteroid; methylprednisolone; mizoribine; mycophenolate mofetil; pamidronic acid; prednisolone; steroid; adolescent; Albers Schoenberg disease; Article; basketball; bone density; bone mineral; case report; child; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; cornea limbus; corticosteroid induced osteoporosis; drug dose increase; drug withdrawal; emergency ward; epiphysis; femoral condyle; follow up; fracture; human; iliac bone; kidney biopsy; knee; knee pain; male; membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; metaphysis; metatarsal bone; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteochondritis dissecans; osteoporosis; osteosclerosis; proteinuria; school child; sclerosis; spondylolysis; stress fracture; vertebra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129666048

Herein, the aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive review on the epidemiological profile and the risk for surgery of athletes presented to a sports injuries clinic in Hong Kong. Methods: A total of 566 patients attending the sports injuries clinic at a local hospital between October 2017 and September 2018 were reviewed. Only 271 patients sustaining injuries from sports activities were included. These patients attended a survey-based data collection session, which recorded their demographic, injury site, events leading to injury, exercise details (type, level-of-play, frequency, experience), and functional score according to the injury site. Results: The highest proportion of injuries was observed in amateur athletes (45.4%) than in recreational (28.8%) and professional (25.8%). Those patients aged between 18–29 years old (50.2%) had the most injuries. Both soccer (25.1%) and basketball (25.1%) were the two most common sports to incurred injuries. Whereas, the lower extremities being the most common injured sites. Based on our logistic model, athletes with less experience were more prone to required surgeries with injuries in the lower extremities. Conclusion: Preventive measures should be targeted at less experience athletes, focusing on strengthening the knee region, to reduce sports-related injuries and surgeries. Importantly, this study demonstrates the need to further identify factors to develop effective sports injury prevention programmes for tailoring athletes at different levels-of-play. © The Author(s) 2022.","basketball; epidemiology; knee; soccer; Sports injuries","adult; amateur athlete; Article; athlete; basketball; controlled study; data collection method; demography; epidemiological surveillance; exercise; experience; female; functional assessment; groups by age; Hong Kong; human; knee injury; leg injury; major clinical study; male; professional athlete; recreational athlete; risk assessment; soccer; sport injury; surgical risk; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128622205

Methods: In total, 321 MND cases and 605 population controls were interviewed collecting information on lifetime histories of playing sports, physical trauma (head injury with concussion, spine injury) and emotional trauma (14 categories). ORs were estimated using logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, smoking status, alcohol consumption and mutually adjusting for all other exposures. Results: Head injury with concussion ≥3 years before diagnosis was associated with MND (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.09–2.09), with strongest associations for two (OR 4.01, 95% CI: 1.82–8.86), and three or more (OR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.00–5.45) head injuries. Spine injury was not associated with MND (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.48–1.36). Compared to never playing sports, engaging in sports throughout childhood and adulthood increased MND risk (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.01–3.25), as was more than 12 years playing football/soccer (OR 2.35, 95% CI: 1.19–4.65). Reporting emotionally traumatic events in more than three categories was associated with MND (OR 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17–3.03), with physical childhood abuse the only specific emotional trauma associated with MND (OR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.14–2.90), particularly for those reporting longer abuse duration (OR(5–8 years) 2.26, 95% CI: 1.14–4.49; OR(&gt;8 years) 3.01, 95% CI: 1.18–7.70). For females, having witnessed another person being killed, seriously injured or assaulted also increased MND risk (OR 2.68, 95% CI: 1.06–6.76). Conclusions: This study adds to the evidence that repeated head injury with concussion, playing sports in general, and playing football (soccer) in particular, are associated with an increased risk of MND. Emotional trauma, that is physical abuse in childhood, may also play a role. © 2022 The Authors.

Methods: Using the Clarivate Analytics Web of Knowledge database and the search term “basketball”, we identified 2,704 articles. These articles were filtered by the total number of citations and the top 50 most cited articles with a central focus on basketball were selected for this analysis. For each article, we further identified and analyzed author name, publication year, country of origin, journal name, article type, main research topic area, competitive level, gender of study population, and the level of evidence. Results: Medicine-related topics, particularly those involving knee injuries, are more common than nonmedical topics (coaching, sports psychology etc.) among the highest cited articles. Articles originated from 13 different countries, with 48% originating in the United States. Only four authors had more than one article included in the top 50 most cited articles. Conclusion: A majority of the top 50 research articles were from English-speaking countries, published after 2000, primarily focused on medicine-related topics, and were Level III evidence. Publications examining knee injuries were the most highly cited and appear to be of high interest to current investigators. The prestige of an author's name appeared to be less influential to the number of citations. Clinical Relevance: The top 50 most cited articles list will provide researchers, medical students, residents, and fellows with a foundational list of the most important and influential academic contributions to the basketball literature. © 2022 The Authors",,"ankle injury; anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; athletic performance; basketball; biomechanics; elite athlete; human; knee; knee injury; mouth injury; sociology; sports medicine; sports psychology; training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124607973

Although there are data available on sports injuries in wheelchair basketball, some aspects need to be clarified, such as the location, mechanisms and risk factors for injury, which are not well described due to variations and/or a lack of definition of injury. The aim of this study was to determine epidemiological information, primary injury characteristics and affected body regions in wheelchair basketball players; Methods: The PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were used; Results: eight articles were included in this review. The shoulder was the body region most affected (N = 60; 22.1%). When divided by body segments, the upper limbs were the most affected (N = 128; 47.2%), followed by the head and/or face (N = 53; 19.5%), trunk (included spine and ribs) (N = 48; 17.8%) and lower limbs (N = 42; 15.5%); Conclusions: wheelchair basketball players suffer a large number of injuries with different characteristics that are mainly linked to biomechanics and sport.

Accordingly, this research aimed to assess PA resources, walkability, and food environments in and around schools in three socioeconomically disadvantaged, regional/rural Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Tasmania, Australia. A census of schools (including assessment of the PA infrastructure quality within school grounds), a walkability assessment, and a census of food outlets surrounding schools (through geospatial mapping) were executed. Most of the schools in the study region had access to an oval, basketball/volleyball/netball court, and free-standing exercise equipment. In all instances (i.e., regardless of school type), the quality of the available infrastructure was substantially higher than the number of incivilities observed. Most schools also had good (i.e., within the first four deciles) walkability. Numerous food outlets were within the walking zones of all schools in the study region, with an abundance of food outlets that predominantly sold processed unhealthy food. © 2022 by the authors.

There is a paucity of literature that describes sports-related hip dislocations. Purpose: To estimate the incidence of sports-related hip dislocations and determine any sport- or sex-related epidemiological trends using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Data regarding sports-related hip dislocations from 2010 to 2019 were retrieved from the NEISS, a database that catalogs injury information during emergency department visits from 100 hospitals across the United States to produce nationwide estimates of the injury burden. The estimated number of injuries was calculated using weights assigned by the NEISS database. The injuries were then stratified by sport and sex to determine any epidemiological patterns. Results: A total of 102 hip dislocation injuries were identified over the surveyed 10 years, indicating 2941 estimated injuries nationwide. Overall, 10 (9.8%) of 102 sports-related hip dislocations presented with concomitant acetabular fractures, representing an estimated 288 injuries nationally over 10 years. Male athletes sustained more sports-related hip dislocations than female athletes, with a relative incidence of 12.51 (P <.001). Adolescents aged 15 to 19 years recorded the highest number of hip dislocations. There were 17 sports identified as having caused at least 1 hip dislocation over the 10-year period. More hip dislocation injuries were sustained from contact sports (91.2%) than noncontact sports (8.8%) (P <.001). Football (estimated 164 injuries per year; 55.6%), snowboarding (28 per year; 9.5%), skiing (26 per year; 8.8%), and basketball (21 per year; 7.1%) had the highest rates of hip dislocation. Additionally, 43 (82.7%) football-related injuries were caused by tackling mechanisms, and 9 (17.3%) were caused by nontackling mechanisms (P <.001). Conclusion: The incidence of traumatic sports-related hip dislocations was extremely low in the United States during the study period. Male adolescents, aged 15 to 19 years, sustained the greatest number of injuries during football. Significantly more hip dislocations occurred in contact sports, most commonly football, snowboarding, skiing, and basketball, compared with noncontact sports. As adolescent athletes may have limited treatment options if osteonecrosis occurs, these data serve to increase the clinical awareness of these injuries. © The Author(s) 2022.","football injuries; NEISS; sports-related hip dislocations; traumatic hip dislocation","acetabulum fracture; Article; athlete; baseball; basketball; dancing; data base; emergency ward; female; football; gymnastics; hip dislocation; hockey; horseback riding; human; injury; lacrosse (sport); major clinical study; male; National Electronic Injury Surveillance System; rugby; running; skiing; soccer; sport; swimming; tennis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129884084

The following variables were analyzed to determine physical persistency across game quarters:(a) total distance covered (m), (b) high-intensity running (HIR) (14–21 km·h−1 ) distance covered (m), (c) sprint (21–30 km·h−1 ) distance covered (m), (d) total accelerations (n), (e) total decelerations (n), (f) relative accelerations (n·min−1 ), (g) relative decelerations (n·min−1 ), (h) ratio of acceleration/deceleration (A/D), (i) total jumps (j) relative jumps (n·min−1 ) (k) player load (AU). using the WIMU PRO® system. Higher but shorter acceleration intensity occurred during the last quarters due to the tight results of the matches. The results suggest that high-intensity efforts such as sprints and HIR seem to increase the A/D ratio (guard and forward positions). Therefore, specific conditioning, as well as eccentric strength training, could be included by practitioners in training programs to improve the performance of these positions during competition, especially as a prior preparation to a game-congested event. Centers seem to have a more variable performance through quarters than do other positions, perhaps highlighting the need for specific conditioning strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

The second aim was to identifying differences in progress of the three types of reaction time between female and male players through computerized tests. The study included 360 subjects for basketball, 130 athletes of which were 68 male subjects and 62 female subjects; for handball, 124 athletes of which 64 were male subjects and 60 female athletes; for volleyball, 106 athletes of which 48 male were subjects and 48 female athletes. Characteristics of the experimental players: average age ± SD 13.60 ± 1.07; average sports experience ± SD 6.24 ± 0.92. The research included an initial and a final test between which a program of exergames was implemented over a period of 3 months focused on optimizing human reaction times. The evaluation of the reaction times was carried out through three computer games, the results being processed in SPSS 22. The relevant results of the research: for the simple motor reaction time (MSRT), the greatest progress between tests was the volleyball group, and for women, it was the basketball group; for the recognition reaction time (RRT), the male handball group and the female basketball group recorded the greatest progress; for the cognitive reactive time (CRT), the greatest progress was achieved by the male and female volleyball players. In all tests, the progress of the female basketball, handball, and volleyball players showed superior progress to similar male players. The results of the research highlighted the effectiveness of the experimental exergame program by using Fitlight technology in optimizing human reaction times in junior team-game athletes. Using computer games to evaluate reaction times allowed us to differentiate the evaluation on the types of human reactions under both standardized conditions but also under conditions of efficiency and attractiveness. © 2022 by the authors.

Few studies have evaluated the results of the Latarjet procedure in this population. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of female athletes who underwent the Latarjet procedure between 2013 and 2018. The participants were followed up for 3 years. The primary outcomes of the study included the visual analog scale for pain; range of motion: active elevation, passive elevation, active external rotation, and passive external rotation. The functional scores were as follows: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index, and the Athletic Shoulder Outcome Rating Scale. Additional data were collected regarding return to sport, complication rates, and patient satisfaction. Results: Thirteen female athletes who practice Soccer, Volleyball, Basketball, Handball, Judo, or Weight training were evaluated. There was a significant reduction in the mean range of motion for all movements at 4 weeks after surgery. Patients recovered a range of motion similar to the preoperative values after 6 months. The mean visual analog scale reached 6.39 at the first week after surgery and decreased to values below preop at 8 weeks. The mean preoperative Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index was 126.77 (min 118; max 135), and at the end of follow-up, the WOSI index was 45.08 (min 37; max 65; P < .05). The mean preoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was 41.61 (min 35; max 46), and at the end of follow-up, the mean ASES score was 84.46 (min 80; max 90; P < .05). The mean Athletic Shoulder Outcome Rating Scale in the preoperative period was 39.38 (min 37; max 42), and at the end of follow-up, the mean ASORS score was 83.15 (min 77; max 85; P < .05). The rate of return to sports was 92.3%, and 84.6% of patients were satisfied with the surgery. The aesthetic satisfaction rate was 76.9%. The complication rate was 15.4% (1 screw failure and 1 dislocation recurrence). Conclusion: Latarjet surgery in female athletes showed high rates of return to sports and improved functional scores without impairing range of motion after the procedure. Recurrence and complication rates were low. In addition, treatment was associated with improved functionality and patient satisfaction. © 2022 The Author(s)","Athletes; Case series; Female; Latarjet; Level IV; Shoulder dislocation; Shoulder injury; Shoulder instability; Shoulder pain; Sports; Treatment Study","analgesic agent; antibiotic agent; adolescent; adult; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score; Article; athlete; Athletic Shoulder Outcome Rating Scale; basketball; bone defect; clinical article; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; echography; female; follow up; fracture immobilization; functional assessment; general anesthesia; glenoid cavity; handball (sport); hospital discharge; human; judo; Latarjet procedure; medical device complication; movement (physiology); muscle training; osteolysis; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; postoperative pain; preoperative evaluation; prescription; professional athlete; prospective study; radiodiagnosis; radiography; range of motion; recurrent shoulder dislocation; reoperation; return to sport; rotation; screw breakage; shoulder surgery; soccer; subluxation; surgical technique; visual analog scale; volleyball; weight training; Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127317678

The aim of this research was evaluation and comparative analysis of the results of a vertical jump between young basketball and handball players. A group of 37 participants took part in the research: 21 basketball players from the basketball club OKK ‘’Novi Pazar’’ (age: 15.5 ± 0.5) from Novi Pazar formed the first subgroup and 16 handball players from the handball club RK ‘’Železničar 1949’’ (age: 25.4 ± 5.8; body height = 193.5 ± 7.5 cm; body weight = 94.0 ± 7.4 kg; body mass index = 25.03 ± 2.38 kg/m2) from Niš formed the second subgroup. Explosive power of the vertical jumps was assessed by the following tests: countermovement jump, countermovement jump/arm swing, squat jump. Participants had at least 5 years of training experience and held similar acute training histories prior to study commencement, completing 4 weeks of baseline conditioning during the general preparatory phase. Participants were free of injury, illness and disease as determined by a team physician prior to study participation. Results The results of the independent samples t-test show that there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between basketball and handball players in all vertical jump tests. Conclusions This article contains new information about vertical jumps of young male basketball and elite male handball players that could be extremely useful for coaches.

Ten elite male college basketball athletes (18.2 ± 0.4 years) were recruited to perform five ball-drills (1V1, 2V2, 3V3, 4V4, and 5V5) which lasted 10 min and varied in intensity. During each drill, TLHRV, training impulse (TRIMP), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), speed, and distance were recorded by Firstbeat, Foster’s RPE scale, and SiMi Scout. The correlation (Spearman’s and Pearson’s correlation coefficient), reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC), and agreement (Bland-Altman plots) among TLHRV, TRIMP, RPE, speed, and distance were examined. TLHRV was significantly correlated with TRIMP (r = 0.34, p = 0.015) and RPE (r = 0.42, p = 0.002). TLHRV was significantly correlated with training intensity (r = 0.477, p = 0.006) but not with volume (r = 0.272, p = 0.056). TLHRV and TRIMP, RPE showed significant intraclass relationships (ICC = 0.592, p = 0.0003). Moreover, TLHRV differentiated basketball drills of equal volume and varying intensity. We concluded that TLHRVmay serve as an objective and rational measure to monitor TL in basketball players.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to: (1) assess the relationship between trunk function and anaerobic power determining proficiency in wheelchair basketball, and (2) define ""natural classes""in wheelchair basketball based on anaerobic power. Fifty-nine elite players (representing five national teams) were divided into four main functional classes: Group 1 (n=17), Group 2 (n=14), Group 3 (n=16), Group 4 (n=12). They performed the 6x10s Anaerobic Power Test using an arm crank ergometer. Average values of mean power, peak power, relative mean power, relative peak power, and power decrement were calculated for the 6x10s and 3x10s tests. The Spearman's correlation matrix revealed significant correlations between classes and values recorded in the 6x10s test. This confirmation between anaerobic power and players' classification endorses the division of players into different classes. Furthermore, cluster analysis (with fair quality) divided players into two ""natural classes"". The first resulting class was mainly formed of participants from Group 1 (71%). An important complement to this research could be to consider wheelchair acceleration and the volume of trunk action in wheelchair basketball classification. © 2022 Jolanta Marszałek, Andrzej Kosmol, Natalia Morgulec-Adamowicz, Anna Mróz, Karol Gryko, Aija Klavina, Kestutis Skucas, José A.

Thirteen elite, junior, male basketball players were monitored using electronic performance tracking systems. There were studied intervals for different time windows to determine the external PD for distance (m); player load; distance covered in four different zones; accelerations; and decelerations. A mixed linear model was run to identify differences among quarters, and the auto-correlation function was carried out to determine fluctuations across the whole game. The results showed significant differences between Q1 vs. Q2 for distance, player load, and standing–walking distance; between Q1 vs. Q3 for distance, player load, and HSR; between Q1 vs. Q4 for distance, player load, standing–walking, and HSR; and between Q3 vs. Q4 for distance and player load. These findings suggest that external PD for running-based demands (distance, player load, and high-speed running) decrease across basketball games with the most notable declines occurring between the first and fourth quarters. Nevertheless, it is important to note that non-significant differences were found between quarters for several external PD variables (jogging, running, acceleration, and deceleration) across different time windows. Findings from the present study reinforce the importance of considering specific PD variables for different functions due to the specific insight each provides.

Methods: US Soccer COVID-19 working group created a return to play manual for its national teams, prescribing discrete phases to return to training and competition. This was underpinned by strict health and safety and travel protocols for specific venues and persons. This was complemented by an aggressive testing cadence and isolation policies for delegations (players, internal and external support staff). Between September 2020 and April 2021, there were nine events for males and females at the youth, senior and Paralympic level, with international opponents hosted domestically. Results: In total, 6590 point of care (POC) (n=1810) and PCR (n=4780) tests combined were run. Overall positivity rate for players and staff in male events of 0.10% (n=2) and 0.00% (n=0) for females were recorded. Staff positivity rate was 0.14% overall, and external vendors 0.10%. Total POC and PCR positives in male events (n=2) occurred either the day of arrival or the following day. Conclusion: The implementation of strictly adhered to protocols and testing cadences yielded low positivity rates within team delegations. By comparison, initial league-wide COVID-19 testing in mid-2020 in other sports reported league-wide positivity rates of 2.9% (National Football League), 2.7% (Major League Soccer) and 5.3% (National Basketball Association). The English Premier League reported an increase in positivity rate in early 2021 from 1.22% to 1.74%. With the implementation of regimented protocols and stringent testing, it is possible to hold elite-level international sporting competitions involving long-haul travel while ensuring continued safety during a global pandemic. © 2022 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","COVID-19; soccer; sports medicine","adolescent; Article; clinical protocol; competition; contact examination; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; environment; false negative result; female; human; immunofluorescence assay; limit of detection; male; pandemic; point of care testing; positivity rate; safety; soccer; soccer player; staff; team sport; training; travel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129589611

Part 1 of this two-paper series published in this Special Issue identified the programme theories—how the programme is supposed to work. A wide and deep network of context, generative mechanisms and outcomes responsible for psychosocial development in this youth performance basketball club emerged. The first paper also concluded that the outcomes and the experience are highly contextual and individualised. In this second part, the stakeholder’s programme theories were tested during a full-season ethnography of the same club. Immersion in the day-to-day environment generated a fine-grain analysis of the processes involved, including: (i) sustained attentional focus; (ii) structured and unstructured skill-building activities; (iii) deliberate and incidental support; and (iv) feelings indi-cating personal growth. Personal development in and through sport is thus shown to be conditional, multi-faceted, time-sensitive and idiosyncratic. The findings of this two-part study are considered to propose a model of psychosocial development in and through sport. This heuristic tool is presented to support sport psychologists, coaches, club administrators and parents to deliberately create and optimise developmental environments. © 2022 by the authors.

The purpose of the current study is twofold: (1) to calculate the BPE in 14–18‐year‐old athletes who participated in individual and team sports and (2) examine how coaches perceived this effect. The participants were 1397 athletes (390 females and 1007 males) who competed in 5 individual (gymnastics, judo, swimming, tennis, and track and field) and 5 team (basketball, soccer, team handball, volleyball, and water polo) sports, as well as 147 coaches who provided their preliminary thoughts about the BPE. Data analyses revealed that although the BPE was not found to be associated with cities of a similar size, it was observed that growing up in cities of small and medium sizes was more beneficial than growing up in towns or cities of other sizes. Most of the coaches believed that certain characteristics of the place or city where the athlete grew up (e.g., proximity to sport facilities) could contribute positively to the athlete’s development. We discuss how the BPE data can aid policymakers in developing a sport policy associated with early phases of talent development. © 2022 by the authors.

Twenty‐two athletes (soccer = 17, basketball = 2, volleyball = 3; 20.1 ± 1.5 y; 1.71 ± 0.11 m; 70.7 ± 12.5 kg) performed three 30‐m (m) sprints on two separate occasions (seven days apart). Six time splits (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 m), horizontal force (HZT F0; N∙kg−1), peak velocity (VMAX; m∙s−1), horizontal power (HZT P0; W∙kg−1), and force–velocity slope (SFV; N∙s∙m−1∙kg−1) were measured. Sprint data for the MLS were compared to the previously validated MySprint (MySp) app to assess for level of agreement. The MLS reported good to excellent reliability for within‐ and between‐day trials (ICC = 0.69–0.98, ICC = 0.77–0.98, respectively). Despite a low level of agreement with HZT F0 (rP = 0.44), the MLS had moderate to excellent agreement across nine variables (rp = 0.68–0.98). Bland–Altman plots displayed significant proportional bias for VMAX (mean difference = 0.31 m∙s−1, MLS &lt; MySp). Overall, the MLS is in agreement with the MySp app and is a reliable device for assessing sprint times, VMAX, HZT P0, and SFV. Proportional bias should be considered for VMAX when comparing the MLS to the MySp app. © 2022 by the authors.

A total of 23 participants (13 men, 10 women; 16–32 years, mean = 20.04 years) who are professionals or school team members further guide a sportsperson to amend their physical tempo to harmonize their psychological and physical states. The self-tuning mechanism between the surroundings and the human can be amplified using interactive music tempo control. The experiments showed that listening to interactive music had a significant effect on the heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of the basketball player compared to those listening to asynchronous music or no music during exercise (p < 0.01). Synchronized interactive music allows athletes to increase their heart rate and decrease RPE during exercise and does not require a multitude of preplanned playlists. All self-selected songs can be converted into sports-oriented music using algorithms. The algorithms of synchronous and asynchronous modes in this study can be adjusted and applied to other sports fields or recovery after exercise. In the future, other musical parameters should be adjusted in real-time based on physiological signals, such as tonality, beats, chords, and orchestration. © 2022 by the authors.

Different concepts of motivation were researched, such as achievement motivation, incentive motivation, participation motivation, goal orientation, satisfaction and enjoyment in sport, self-efficacy, effort, and ability attributions. The most popular framework for motivation in sport lately has been social cognitive perspective. The aim of this study was to form a dynamic interactive model of sport motivation. We tried to upgrade different models of motivation to one unique meta model of sport motivation, which would explain possible behaviours and motivation in sport situations. Different statistic methods were used to define differences among young and elite athletes and between athletes in group and individual sports. The results show important differences among those groups and suggest that specific sport discipline also has a specific footprint inside motivation. Factor analysis and discriminant analysis were used to explore sport motivation space.

The experiences of athletes and their families during the RTP process are unknown. Objective: To understand current RTP processes. Methods: We administered a mixed-methods telephone interview combining quantitative and qualitative components to 30 athletes with a GHD who had RTP, and 23 parents. Participants were identified from the Yale ICD Sports registry and Mayo Clinic's Windland Smith Rice Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic. Qualitative data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to identify common themes. Results: Most common diagnoses were long QT syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and most common sports, soccer, basketball, and football. Twenty-three athletes encountered ≥1 perceived barrier(s) to RTP: 17 were restricted by their first cardiologist; 6 were required to meet with school administrators, 4 signed waivers, and 3 hired lawyers. Common themes expressed by athletes and their parents were frustration with poor communication, perceived lack of physician knowledge of their diagnosis, and unilateral, paternalistic decision-making, as well as cynicism that physicians and schools were primarily concerned with liability. After RTP, 26 athletes had some form of emergency action plan, although responsibility was often left to the family. Conclusion: Many perceived barriers exist for athletes with GHD who wish to RTP after their diagnoses.

(2) Methods: Cross-sectional study with 778 basketball players. Specific tests and trials were conducted to evaluate members of teams from several clubs in male and female from under 12 (U12) to under 17 (U17) categories. The evaluations consisted of static physical measurements and dynamic measurements. (3) Results: 575 players were included in this study. A total of 95% of participants are unable to keep their ankle stable in monopodial loading; 86% present dynamic lower extremity valgus with statistically significant differences between categories (p = 0.004); 94% are unable to keep the pelvis stable when performing a single-leg squat; 93% are unable to keep their trunk stable when performing the same movement. During landing, 96% present dynamic lower extremity valgus. The thighs of 92% do not reach parallel (peak of jump).

Traumatic mesenteric injuries are difficult to diagnose and their undiagnosed complications are severe with high mortality rates. Case presentation: A 21-year-old male presented to the emergency room with severe colicky pain in the right-hypochondrium 2 h after dinner. He gave history of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after dinner and before the pain started. The morning after admission, a Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) scan was done which showed a large mesenteric hematoma. On subsequent questioning, the patient then recalled a blow to the abdomen while playing basketball two days ago. Since the patient was hemodynamically stable, non-operative management (NOM) was chosen with close monitoring. Regular follow-up ultrasonography (USG) scans showed progressive spontaneous resolution of the hematoma. Clinical discussion: Nonspecific symptoms of mesenteric hematoma make it difficult to reach a diagnosis. It is usually identified by history or medical imaging. Mesenteric hematoma can be managed conservatively if there is no active bleeding. In stable patients, selective visceral angiography should be performed and bleeding vessels should be embolized where possible. Conclusion: This case highlights a successful conservative management of a large traumatic mesenteric hematoma. It also emphasizes the importance of eliciting a detailed history of major or minor trauma for any patient with abdominal pain. Previous cases have also highlighted the importance of non-operative management and avoidance of emergency laparotomy in stable patients. © 2022 The Authors","Blunt abdominal trauma; Case report; Mesenteric hematoma; Superior mesenteric artery","analgesic agent; antibiotic agent; emetic agent; ferrous sulfate; hemoglobin; omeprazole; tranexamic acid; abdominal blunt trauma; abdominal pain; acute gastroenteritis; adult; Article; blood sampling; case report; celiac angiography; clinical article; colic; computer assisted tomography; conservative treatment; echography; emergency ward; feces analysis; fluid resuscitation; follow up; hematoma; hemoglobin blood level; human; intensive care unit; leukocyte count; male; superior mesenteric angiography; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126151830

Methods: Patients undergoing arthroscopic labral surgery between January 2018 and June 2020 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria for labral injury were consistently applied and included history, clinical examination and imaging findings, and failure of rehabilitation. Exclusion criteria included arthritis, adhesive capsulitis, and previous surgery. Injury locations were categorized into superior, anterior, and/or posterior areas on the glenoid and as isolated in one area or combined in more than one area. Injury patterns also were evaluated. Interrater and intrarater agreement was assessed between 2 raters for injury location and tear pattern for 22 randomly assigned cases. Results: In total, 167 cases met the inclusion criteria. Injuries were found in all areas. Combined injuries were found almost twice as often as isolated injuries (63.5% vs 37.5%). Isolated posterior injuries had the greatest frequency of all specific injury types (26.3%). Isolated superior injuries (SLAP 2-4) had a frequency of 7.2%. Tear patterns included peel back, separation/split, insubstance injury, peripheral rim flattening, and extension into the posterior inferior glenohumeral ligament. Interrater was excellent for all tear locations (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥0.85) whereas intrarater agreement was good to excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥0.63). Conclusions: Labral injuries that are associated with clinical symptoms can occur as isolated or combined types in the superior, anterior, and posterior glenoid areas and can display multiple injury patterns. Combined types of injuries are almost twice as common as those that are isolated in one area. Posterior injuries, isolated or combined, are frequent but superior injuries are less common Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series. © 2021 The Authors",,"adolescent; adult; anterior injury; arthroscopy; Article; baseball; basketball; clinical examination; college; female; football; glenoid labral injury; human; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; joint injury; major clinical study; male; posterior injury; shoulder injury; shoulder joint; soccer; softball; sport injury; superior injury; volleyball; wrestling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121672431

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to report the epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes of maxillofacial injuries in NCAA Division I athletes participating in 13 sports. It was hypothesized that the rate of maxillofacial injuries would be greater than previously reported in national registry studies. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A single-institution registry was utilized to retrieve the maxillofacial injuries and surgical procedures recorded over 4 athletic seasons, for the years 2015 through 2019, across 13 NCAA Division I sports. The incidence of injuries per sport was reported as the number per 1000 athlete-exposure (AE) hours. The time lost from participation and time to complete injury resolution per sport were reported as the mean and range. Results: A total of 193 maxillofacial injuries occurred over 4 seasons. The overall incidence of maxillofacial injuries was 2.06 injuries per 1000 AE hours. The injury incidence for male and female athletes was 1.92 and 2.43 injuries per 1000 AE hours, respectively. Men’s basketball (8.30 injuries per 1000 AE hours) and men’s water polo (8.15 injuries per 1000 AE hours) had the highest rates of all sports. Overall, 20 athletes (10.4%) required surgery. The mean time to resolution across all sports was 33.3 days (range, 0-336 days) per injury. The mean time lost across all sports was 17.1 days (range, 0-336 days) per injury. Conclusion: At a single NCAA Division I institution, maxillofacial injuries occurred at a higher rate than previously thought and could lead to significant time lost from sport participation. Basketball players were at the highest risk of this injury. Across all sports, male athletes took longer to return to sport after a maxillofacial injury compared to female athletes, but the latter required more time to fully recover. Maxillofacial injuries may require surgical treatment, and their prevention is critical. © The Author(s) 2022.","collegiate; Division I; epidemiology; maxillofacial; NCAA; time lost","adult; Article; athlete; athletic trainer; athletics; basketball player; female; football player; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; maxillofacial injury; medical education; prospective study; retrospective study; return to sport; sport injury; water polo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127157365

Interestingly, different regions of the brain were engaged according to the type of sports analyzed. Our laboratory reported no difference in total cerebellar volume of basketball players compared to that in the control group using the manual segmentation method. Further detailed analyses showed that elite basketball players had increased volume of the striatum and vermian lobules VI–VII of the cerebellum. We analyzed the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of basketball players to understand their cerebral cortical plasticity through automatic analysis tools for MRI. Methods: Brain MRI data were collected from 19 male university basketball players and 20 age-, sex-, and height-matched control groups. In order to understand the changes in the cerebral cortices of basketball players, we employed automated MRI brain analysis techniques, including voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM). Results: VBM showed increased gray and white matter volume in both precentral gyri, paracentral lobules and increased gray matter volume in the right anterior superior temporal gyrus. SBM revealed a left dominant increase in both pericentral gyri. Fractal dimensional analysis showed an increase in the area of both precentral gyri, the left subcallosal gyrus, and the right posterior cingulate gyrus. These results suggest a significant role not only for the primary motor cortex, but also for the cingulate gyrus during basketball. Conclusion: Plastic changes of both precentral gyri, the pericentral area, paracentral lobules, and the right superior temporal gyrus were observed in elite basketball players. There was a strong increase of fractal complexity in both precentral gyri and a weak increase in the right posterior cingulate gyrus and left collateral gyrus. In this study, plastic regions linked to functional neuroanatomy were related to the competence required to play basketball. © 2022 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.

To date, little is known about sex-related differences in sports adaptations. The aim of the present study is to identify sex-related sports adaptation proteins in female basketball players and male basketball players using proteomics approach on plasma samples withdrawn from athletes during in-season training period but far from a competition. A cohort of 20 professional basketball players, 10 female (BF) and 10 male (BM), and 20 sedentary male (10 CM) and female (10 CF) as control, of comparable age and BMI, were involved in this study. Protein profiles of plasma samples obtained from BM, BF, CM, and CF were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The computational 2-DE gel image analysis pointed out 33 differentially expressed protein spots (ANOVA p-value < 0.05) and differences between male and female basketball players are more evident among the players than controls. The expression profile of 54.5% of the total proteins is affected by sports activity. Furthermore, 14 proteins are differentially expressed in basket female players in comparison with their relative controls while seven are differentially expressed in basket male players in comparison with their controls. In conclusion, we identify in female athletes a reduction in proteins related to transcription regulation, most of these modulate chronic inflammation confirming the anti-inflammatory effect of regular training in female muscle metabolism. In male and female athletes, we found a decrease in Transthyretin involved in muscle homeostasis and regeneration and Dermcidin a stress-induced myokine linked to inflammatory and it will be interesting to fully understand the role of its different isoforms in male and female skeletal muscle contraction.

Purpose: To determine return-to-play (RTP) and player performance in the first and second season after concussion in National Basketball Association (NBA) players. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: An online database of publicly available NBA athlete injuries was queried for instances of “concussion” between 2010 and 2018. The age at injury, team, position, height, weight, body mass index, NBA experience, date of concussion, date of return, and seasons played postconcussion was recorded for each player. Regular-season statistics (games started, games played, minutes played, and player efficiency rating [PER]) were compiled for the season before, and 2 seasons immediately after, injury. Kaplan-Meier survivorship plots were computed for athlete RTP and retirement endpoints. Results: A total of 81 injuries were identified from 2010 to 2018, with a rate of 2.0 concussions per 100 player-years. Overall RTP was 100% after concussion, with nearly all (88%) returning in the season of injury; 12% of players experienced a season-ending concussion. RTP averaged 37.3 days after injury, varying widely (range, 2-291 days). Compared with preinjury season (78.0%), athletes played in significantly fewer overall games in the season of injury (36.6%; P <.0001), as well as 1 (69.5%; P =.0229) and 2 seasons postinjury (73.2%; P =.3192). PER scores were not significantly different across the study period. Each point increase in a player’s preinjury PER score was associated with a 2.4% decrease in PER from the preinjury season to season of injury (P =.0016) and a 3.1% decrease from preinjury to season after injury (P =.0053). Each increasing year of age or year of experience was associated with 5% decline in PER score at 1 season after injury. Conclusion: NBA players had a high RTP after concussion, with most returning in the same season as the injury. Players sustaining concussions played significantly fewer games for at least 2 seasons after injury. Performance via PER did not change across the entire cohort; however, players with higher preinjury PER, and older players were more likely to sustain a greater decline in performance after injury. © The Author(s) 2022.","concussion; NBA; performance; player efficiency rating; return-to-play","adult; Article; basketball player; body height; body mass; body weight; concussion; data base; female; human; major clinical study; male; return to sport; risk factor; season; sport injury; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126737107

Knowledge of the risk factors would be relevant to help prevent athletes’ injuries. We aimed to study risk factors associated with non-contact ACL injuries in a population of athletes after ACL reconstruction. From a cohort of 307 athletes, two populations were compared according to the non-contact or contact mechanism of ACL injury. Gender, age and body mass index (BMI) were reported. Passive knee alignment (valgus and extension), knee laxity (KT-1000 test), and isokinetic knee strength were measured on the non-injured limb. The relationship between these factors and the non-contact sport mechanism was established with models using logistic regression analysis for the population and after selection of gender and cut-offs of age, BMI and knee laxity calculated from Receiver Operating Characteristics curve area and Youden index. Age, BMI, antero-posterior laxity, isokinetic knee strength, passive knee valgus and passive knee extension were associated with non-contact ACL injury. According to the multivariate model, a non-contact ACL injury was associated with non-modifiable factors, age (OR: 1.05; p = 0.001), passive knee extension (OR: 1.14; p = 0.001), and with one modifiable factor (Hamstring strength: OR: 0.27; p = 0.01). For women, only passive knee valgus was reported (OR: 1.27; p = 0.01). Age, passive knee extension and weak Hamstring strength were associated with a non-contact ACL injury.

This study aimed to (1) examine and quantify the training load (TL) in youth national team basketball players during a 2-week training camp according to maturity timing and (2) determine which parameters were related to under-18 (U18) national team selection. Twenty-nine U-16 national team basketball players underwent an anthropometric assessment to determine maturity timing. Players were categorised by maturity timing (early vs. average), whilst TL parameters during a 2-week training camp (i.e., 21 sessions) prior to FIBA U16 European Championship were used for group comparison and to predict future U-18 national team selection. The early-maturing players, who were taller and heavier (p < 0.05), experienced greater training strain in week 1 (p < 0.05) only. Irrespective of maturity timing, training loads in week 2 were predictive of onward selection for the U-18 national team. Conclusion: Based on present findings, practitioners are encouraged to develop their athletes’ ability to tolerate high weekly loads, but also to be mindful that athletes’ perceived exertion during national team training may be influenced by maturity timing. © 2022 by the authors.

This study aimed to measure the physique, physical strength, and lower extremity stability of such athletes in Korea and analyze the differences according to their play positions. Overall, 204 male elite basketball players participated and were classified as guard (n = 97), forward (n = 69), and center (n = 38) according to their main playing position. All sub-variables of physique were significantly higher in the forward and center groups than in the guard group, and were significantly higher in the center group than in the forward group. Strength was significantly higher in the forward and center groups than in the guard group. Agility and speed were significantly faster in the guard group than in the forward and center groups. Y-balance analysis showed that the composite score of both feet tended to be higher in the order of center, forward, and guard, and it was significantly higher in the guard group than in the center group.

This study aimed to investigate the correlations between both objective and subjective external (eTL) and internal (iTL) intensities. A total of 95 primary education students participated in this study. In this regard, 40 played soccer, and 55 performed basketball tasks, recording a total of 3956 units of analysis. The intensities caused by the different soccer and basketball tasks were measured using objective techniques (inertial devices and heart rate monitors) and subjective techniques (a sheet of task analysis and ratings of perceived exertion). Matrix scatter plots were made to show the values of two variables for a dataset. In this regard, adjustment lines were plotted to determine the trend of the correlations. Then, Spearman’s correlation was calculated to measure the association between two variables. Despite the low correlation levels obtained, the main results showed significant positive correlations between the intensities. This means that the high intensity values recorded by objective techniques also implied high intensity values recorded by subjective techniques, and vice versa. Negative correlations (r Rho = −0.19; p = 0.00) were only found between the following eTL variables: task eTL per minute (subjective technique) and player load per minute (objective technique). This negative correlation occurred when students played in the same 3 vs. 3 game situation without variability in subjective eTL (M ± SD, 28.00 ± 0.00). Therefore, subjective eTL and iTL techniques could be proposed as a suitable alternative for planning and monitoring the intensities supported by students in physical education classes. Moreover, these subjective techniques are easy to use in schools. © 2022 by the authors.

This study aimed to gain an understanding of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being and sports readiness to train and to compete of competitive female and male athletes practicing outdoor (i.e., rugby, soccer) and indoor (i.e., volleyball, basketball) team sports who were active during the Italian first and second waves of COVID-19. Methods: An online survey assessing demographic characteristics, perceived safety of the training environment, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19, well-being, and sport (training and competition) readiness was administered to 619 team sports players. We examined differences by gender, previous COVID-19 experience, and team sport setting (i.e., outdoor vs. indoor). A moderated mediation analysis was conducted to assess the impact of perceived COVID-19 risk and fear of COVID-19 on athletes’ well-being and sports readiness, using perceived safety of the training environment as a mediator and gender and sport setting as moderators. Results: Indoor team sports and female athletes showed higher perceived COVID-19 risk, while athletes with no-COVID-19 experience reported higher fear of COVID-19. Perceived COVID-19 risk (directly and via perceived safety of the training environment) and fear of COVID-19 were negatively associated with athletes’ well-being and sports readiness. Conclusions: This study highlighted an understanding of the psychological implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the role of the perceived safety of the training environment on athletes’ well-being and sports readiness. Future studies may advance safety-based interventions to promote well-being and a safer return to sport. © 2022 by the authors.

Thirty-two male players (age: 14.5 ± 0.5 years of age) were randomly divided into SSGs group (n = 16) and HIIT group (n = 16) training methods thrice per week for 6 weeks. The players in the SSGs group performed two 5–8 min of 2 vs. 2 with 2 min rest periods, while the players in HIIT performed 12–18 min of runs at intensities (90 to 95%) related to the velocity obtained in the 30-15 intermittent fitness test (IFT). Pre-testing and post-testing sessions involved assessments of Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1, 30-15 intermittent fitness test, 5 and 30 m sprint times, vertical jump height, repeated sprint ability, defensive and offensive agility, and technical skills. The SSGs group demonstrated significantly higher agility-based technical responses in terms of the control dribbling and shooting skills (d = 1.71 vs. 0.20, d = 1.41 vs. 0.35, respectively) compared with the HIIT group. Conversely, the HIIT induced greater improvements in 30 m sprint times (d = 3.15 vs. 0.68). These findings provided that SSGs in youth basketball players may allow similar positive physical adaptations to HIIT, with an extra advantage of improving technical skills while improving enjoyability. © 2022, MDPI.

A total of 167 children were involved in regular school sport (control group), while 233 received both school sport and a dedicated physical activities program (intervention group). Standardized photographic habitual body posture examination was performed at enrollment (T0) and one-year after (T1). Sacral slope (SS), lumbar lordosis (LL), thoracic kyphosis (TK), chest inclination (CI), and head protraction (HP) were measured. At T0, the body posture parameters did not differ between groups. At T1 in the controls, all five parameters tended to deteriorate (insignificant): SS p = 0.758, LL p = 0.38, TK p = 0.328, CI p = 0.081, and HP p = 0.106. At T1 in the intervention group, the SS decreased (p = 0.001), the LL tended to decrease (p = 0.0602), and the TK, CI, and HP remained unaltered. At T1, the SS and LL parameter differed between groups statistically (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0064, respectively) and clinically (2.52◦ and 2.58◦, respectively).

We conducted a natural experiment with pre–post measures taken from women in the 12 villages in Samoa, some of which voluntarily participated in the sport-for-development intervention. The intervention comprised a six-week netball league delivered by local volunteers who attended coaching workshops, received ongoing support from the national governing body and were provided with infrastructure and equipment to conduct local training sessions. Changes in netball participation, recreational physical activity, body composition, mental wellbeing and socio-ecological determinants of physical activity were compared between intervention and comparison villages using a univariate ANOVA. The intervention reached women who participated in little recreational physical activity and had poor physical and mental wellbeing. Program uptake was higher in villages with the strongest social support for netball participation. Local social support and capacity to independently organize netball activities increased. There were concurrent improvements in netball participation, physical activity levels, mental wellbeing and body weight in the intervention villages.

This study aims to improve the right and the left balance of adolescent basketball players aged 16 and 18 years old and determine the difference in the effect of theraband exercise and bosu ball exercise. The study was conducted to determine the effect of ankle strengthening exercise using bosu ball exercise and theraband exercise on the balance of male basketball players aged 16 years and 18 years is a type of quantitative research. The research design used is experimental research with 2x2 factorial analysis, and the level of significance was set a 0.05 for all samples. The sample in this study amounted to 64 men’s basketball players, with details of 32 players in the age group 16 and 32 players in the age group 18. Players in the age group 16 and age 18 were each divided into 4 sample groups using the ABBA formula, so that the number in each sample group consists of 8 players. Pre-test left theraband exercise and post-test left theraband exercise = 5% (0.05) > sig. (2-tailed) 0.000, it can be interpreted that there is a significant change in left balance for basketball players aged 16 years after being given theraband exercise treatment. Pre-test left bosu ball exercise and post-test left bosu ball exercise on left balance the value of = 5% (0.05) > sig. (2-tailed) 0.001, then it can be interpreted that there is a significant change in left balance for basketball players aged 16 years after being given bosu ball exercise treatment. Pre-test left theraband exercise and post-test left theraband exercise = 5% (0.05) > sig. (2-tailed) 0.005, it can be interpreted that there is a significant change in left balance for basketball players aged 18 years after being given the theraband exercise treatment. Pre-test left theraband exercise and post-test left theraband exercise = 5% (0.05) > sig. (2-tailed) 0.005, it can be interpreted that there is a significant change in left balance for basketball players aged 18 years after being given the theraband exercise treatment. Characteristics of the age group of 16 years and 18 years are not much different. Bosu ball exercises give a better effect than theraband exercise. Although statistically not too significant, there is a difference in the average. That condition is because the motor system works more, starting from the legs, back, and abdomen muscles. The motor system that works when doing theraband exercise tends to be on the muscles in the legs. © Pratama D.

While these exercises seem to be efficient in the prevention of injuries, there is insufficient evidence regarding their role in sport-specific performance and related functional movements. The aim of this scoping review is (1) to map the literature that investigates whether currently available variables of postural and core stability are functionally related to athlete performance in sports with high demands on body balance and spinal posture and (2) to identify gaps in the literature and suggest further research on this topic. The literature search conducted on MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases was completed by Google Scholar, SpringerLink, and Elsevier. Altogether 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. Findings revealed that postural stability plays an important role in performance in archery, biathlon, gymnastics, shooting, and team sports (e.g., basketball, hockey, soccer, tennis). Also core stability and strength represent an integral part of athlete performance in sports based on lifting tasks and trunk rotations. Variables of these abilities are associated with performance-related skills in cricket, cycling, running, and team sports (e.g., baseball, football, hockey, netball, soccer, tennis). Better neuromuscular control of postural and core stability contribute to more efficient functional movements specific to particular sports. Training programs incorporating general and sport-specific exercises that involve the use of postural and core muscles showed an improvement of body balance, back muscle strength, and endurance. However, there is controversy about whether the improvement in these abilities is translated into athletic performance. There is still a lack of research investigating the relationship of body balance and stability of the core with sport-specific performance. In particular, corresponding variables should be better specified in relation to functional movements in sports with high demands on postural and core stability. Identifying the relationship of passive, active, and neural mechanisms underlying balance control and spinal posture with athlete performance would provide a basis for a multifaced approach in designing training and testing tools addressing postural and core stability in athletes under sport-specific conditions.

Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the 2020 COVID-19 period on emergency department (ED) visits for sports-related injuries in the United States. It was hypothesized that such visits decreased in response to the pandemic conditions. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A selection of sports (baseball, basketball, softball, soccer, American football, weightlifting, track and field, martial arts, boxing, golf, personal fitness, cycling, tennis, and ice hockey) were classified as being an organized team, organized individual, or nonorganized sport. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database was then queried for ED visits for sports-related injuries between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020, and we compared weighted national injury estimates and injury characteristics from athletes presenting to EDs in 2018 and 2019 versus those from the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic period and between March 1 and May 31, 2020 (government-imposed lockdown period). Bivariate comparisons between variables were conducted using chi-square analysis, with strength of association assessed using odds ratios. Results: The 164,151 unweighted cases obtained from the query resulted in a weighted national estimate of 5,664,795 sports-related injuries during the study period. Overall, there was a 34.6% decrease in sports-related ED visits in 2020 compared with the yearly average between 2018 and 2019 (baseline). The number of ED visits in 2020 decreased by 53.9% versus baseline for injuries incurred by participation in an organized team sport and by 34.9% for injuries incurred by participation in an organized individual sport. The number of ED visits during the 2020 lockdown period decreased by 76.9% versus baseline for injuries incurred by participation in an organized team sport and by 65.8% for injuries incurred by participation in an organized individual sport. Injuries sustained while participating in a nonorganized sport remained relatively unaffected and decreased by only 8.1% in 2020. Conclusion: ED visits in the United States for injuries sustained while participating in an organized team or individual sport underwent a decrease after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, especially during the lockdown period. © The Author(s) 2022.","baseball; basketball; boxing; cycling; football; golf; hockey; soccer; softball; tennis","adult; Article; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dynamometry; female; goniometry; human; low back pain; male; middle aged; muscle flexibility; muscle strength; musculoskeletal function; pilot study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125863538

In particular, research on knowledge of, and attitudes toward, concussion is necessary for the establishment of concussion education for Japanese collegiate athletes. The aim of the present study was to assess the knowledge of, and attitudes toward, concussion in Japanese male collegiate athletes and to investigate their experiences with suspected concussion symptoms. An online questionnaire was administered to 390 collegiate athletes participating in the following five sports with a high incidence of concussion: rugby union, soccer, basketball, American football, and judo. Of the 121 valid responses, 91 (77.1%) indicated that they had experienced suspected concussion symptoms at least once and 46 of these 91 respondents had not reported their symptoms of suspected concussion at least once. Athletes who had never experienced concussion symptoms were significantly less likely to recognize the symptoms of concussion (p < 0.001). Most athletes recognized headache and dizziness as suspected concussion symptoms. However, the recognition rate for several symptoms was lower than the prevalence of these symptoms as shown in previous studies. This suggests that educational initiatives might be important to bridge the gap between athletes' knowledge and understanding of frequently occurring concussion symptoms and to improve reporting behavior.

A secondary purpose was to determine if the PCA results were sensitive to load demands of different positional groups (POS). Data comprised 229 observations obtained from 10 men's basketball athletes participating in NCAA DI competitions. Each athlete donned an inertial measurement unit that was affixed to the same location on their shorts prior to competition. The PCA revealed two factors that possessed eigenvalues &gt;1.0 and explained 81.42% of the total variance. The first factor comprised total decelerations (totDEC, 0.94), average speed (avgSPD, 0.90), total accelerations (totACC, 0.85), total mechanical load (totMECH, 0.84), and total jump load (totJUMP, 0.78). Maximum speed (maxSPD, 0.94) was the lone contributor to the second factor. Based on the PCA, external load variables were included in a multinomial logistic regression that predicted POS (Overall model, p &lt; 0.0001; AUCcenters = 0.93, AUCguards = 0.88, AUCforwards = 0.80), but only maxSPD, totDEC, totJUMP, and totMECH were significant contributors to the model's success (p &lt; 0.0001 for each). Even with the high significance, the model still had some issues differentiating between guards and forwards, as in-game demands often overlap between the two positions. Nevertheless, the PCA was effective at simplifying a large external load dataset collected on NCAA DI men's basketball athletes. These data revealed that maxSPD, totDEC, totJUMP, and totMECH were the most sensitive to positional differences during competitions. To best characterize competition demands, such variables may be used to individualize training and recovery regimens most effectively.

The aim of our study was to present different characteristics in the athletes, on the one hand signs of a high vagal tone in the 12-lead ECG as criteria of early repolarization (ER), furthermore echocardiographic remodeling parameters and finally the performance in CPET. Therefore, we divided the cohort into a group with signs of ER pattern in the 12-lead ECG and without these criteria and presented the differences in detail. Materials and Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective study performed in 27 professional basketball players (age: 26.5 ± 7.5 years, male: 27, height: 197.2 ± 12 cm, weight: 100 ± 17 kg, BMI: 25.7 ± 3.4 kg/m2). All participants underwent a sports medicine checkup, ECG analysis, transthoracic echocardiographic examination, and a CPET on a cycle ergometer between 2015 and 2019 during their pre-season preparation time. All individuals were healthy people without cardiological advance anamnesis. After assessment, two groups were built based on electrocardiographic criteria of ER pattern and a group without these criteria and compared against each other for parameters of echocardiographic assessment, CPET, and 12-lead ECG analysis. Data were analyzed with Minitab statistic program (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, United States) and Graph Pad Prism 8.2.1 (279; Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA, United States) using ANOVA testing with post-hoc testing and unpaired t-testing (p ≤ 0.05). Retrospectively additional information was collected referring to the management of training sessions, recovery time, and nutrition by interviewing the athletic training staff in order to understand the principles for individual athlete’s training management and physiological and cardiopulmonary interactions. Results: Comparing professional basketball players with ER pattern to those with no ER pattern, significant differences were found for CPET, echocardiographic, and ECG analysis (p &lt; 0.05). Absolute and relativized peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak; ER 4120 ± 750 ml/min (39 ± 5.4 ml/kg/min) vs. non-ER 3556 ± 393 ml/min (37.2 ± 5.3 ml/kg/min), p = 0.018) and maximum workload during CPET (ER 310 ± 51.5 Watt (2.94 ± 0.35 W/kg) vs. non-ER 271 ± 32 Watt (2.85 ± 0.49 W/kg), p = 0.026) was higher in athletes with an ER pattern. Furthermore, ER pattern athletes showed a higher enddiastolic left ventricular diameter (LVedd; ER 58.3 ± 7.9 mm vs. non-ER 53.6 ± 3.6 mm, p = 0.048) and a significantly enlarged left atrial (LA) endsystolic diameter (ER 23.33 ± 2.71 mm vs. non-ER 20.47 ± 2.29 mm, p = 0.006) as well as a significantly enlarged right atrial (RA) endsystolic diameter (ER 23.42 ± 2.15 mm vs. non-ER 20.93 ± 3.28 mm, p = 0.033). Significant differences between the two compared groups could be revealed for left ventricular mass Index (LVMI gr/m2; LVMI ER 113 gr/m2 ± 17.5 vs. LVMI non-ER 91.3 gr/m2 ± 15.1, p = 0.002), but no significant differences for the relative wall thickness were found (RWT; RWT ER 0.49 ± 0.11 vs. RWT non-ER 0.38 ± 0.06, p = 0.614). Conclusion: Professional basketball players with criteria of ER pattern showed different results in CPET and cardiac remodeling as athletes with no ER pattern. These findings should encourage the athletic training staff to emphasize the quality of an individual training schedule for each athlete based on the cardiopulmonary pre-season sport medicine checkup. Nevertheless, echocardiographic findings, ER pattern, and performance in CPET have to be interpreted referring the sport-specific and athlete’s ethnical background.

The observation sample contained all offensive sequences ending in a shot by the US men's wheelchair basketball team, who won the gold medal at the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Data were annotated and coded in the Lince software program and their reliability confirmed by measuring interobserver agreement using Cohen's kappa statistics. Log-linear modeling showed that the models generated to explain offensive sequences ending in a shot by players with greater functional ability were closest to models observed for professional basketball players and were the only models to show significant effects in terms of efficiency. © 2022 Rubén Arroyo, Roberto Alsasua, Javier Arana, Daniel Lapresa, M.

Fifty-nine adolescent girls (13.2 ± 0.3 years) were randomly assigned to a group that participated in a game-based after-school program (EXP) or a control group (CON) that participated only in mandatory physical education. The EXP group had the additional program twice a week after school for 40 min/session for 12 weeks alongside with regular physical education classes. The EXP program consisted mainly of small-sided games of football, basketball, handball, and volleyball. The assessment included a physical fitness assessment with standardized tests for this age group: countermovement jump (CMJ), standing long jump, bent arm hang, overhead medicine ball throw, sit-ups for 30 s, and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Level 1 Test (YYIRT1). There was a significant interaction between group (EXP vs. CON) and time (pre-test vs. post-test) for the standing long jump (p < 0.001), overhead medicine ball throw (p < 0.001), 30 s sit-ups (p = 0.030), bent- arm hang (p < 0.001), and YYIRT1 score (p = 0.004). In addition, a significant main effect was found for time in countermovement jump (p < 0.001). The results of this study indicate that the after-school game-based intervention significantly improves adolescent girls' physical fitness compared to regular physical education. The overall conclusion suggests that as few as two additional sessions per week are sufficient to produce significant changes in physical fitness in adolescent girls.

The optimal approach to cardiac risk stratification following SARS-CoV-2 infection in athletes for a safe return to play (RTP) still needs defining. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of abnormal RTP test results, according to the protocol of Italian Federation of Sport Medicine (FMSI), which was endorsed by the Italian Ministry of Health, potentially representing COVID-19-associated cardiac injuries. Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter, observational study. All consecutive competitive athletes who underwent COVID-19 RTP testing protocol from 1 May to 31 July 2021, across 60 Italian Centers of Sports Medicine, were enrolled in the study. Athletes were tested at least 30 days after negativization of the nasopharyngeal swab (or immediately after negativization in professional athletes or Probable Olympians). A 12-lead electrocardiography at rest and during maximal incremental exercise test with continuous O2 saturation monitoring and an echocardiographic examination were part of the protocol. In athletes with “moderate” disease (NHI classification), 24 h ECG monitoring (to be performed on a training day) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were also performed. Results: A total of 4143 athletes (67.8% males and 32.2% females) (53% &gt; 18 years, 20% 18–35 years and 16% &gt; 35 years), from more than 40 different sport disciplines, were included in the study. The mean age was 22.5 ± 13.3 years, with ages ranging from 8 to 80 years. Of these athletes, 52.3% were asymptomatic, 46.4% manifested mild symptoms, 1.1% and 0.14% had moderate or severe symptoms, respectively, while critical illness was evident in one athlete. Abnormal echocardiographic findings were detected in 80 cases (1.9%), and pericarditis in 7 cases (0.2%); all were from mildly symptomatic athletes. Arrhythmic events were recorded in 239 athletes, with 224 (5.4%) in the exercise test and 15 (0.4%) during 24 h ECG monitoring. Ventricular arrhythmias were observed in 101 (2.4%) athletes from the total population (mostly isolated or couples of premature ventricular beats): 91 in the exercise test and 10 during 24 h ECG monitoring. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed in 34 athletes; the presence of myocarditis was confirmed in 5 athletes (0.12% of the total population, 14.7% of athletes in which MRI was performed). Conclusions: According to our results, cardiac complications from SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic competitive athletes are rare, and an RTP assessment based on symptoms and ECG-monitored exercise test would ensure a safe RTP in these athletes. © 2022 by the authors.

Previous research showed that in the case of individual awards, points are preferred over other indicators of effectiveness. Based on recent studies and following Simon’s bounded rationality, in our interpretation, decision-makers decide on nominations at the post-grant level according to points scoring which is the easiest aspect to assess and the most familiar to them. In this context we also hypothesise that youth all-star players have better overall performance than their not selected teammates. To test our hypotheses we selected all of the youth awarded male players and their teammates from 2004 to 2019. In our sample, we examined n = 3198 player statistics. Two groups were created with nominated and not selected players. We used a two-sample t-test, and correlation matrix to examine the relationship between the variables (p < 0.001). We found that scoring is the most important selection criteria for decision-makers (r = 0.605; p = 0.000) and the selected players had significantly better individual statistics. An important finding of our study is that although efficiency (EFF) is used to measure the players’ contribution to the game, it is not the primary selection factor and should therefore be redefined. © 2022 by the authors.

Oxidative stress, adiponectin level, and metabolic profile were determined. Male and female athletes showed an increased antioxidant capacity (27% for males; 21% for females) and lactate level (389% for males; 460% for females) and reduced salivary cortisol (25% for males; 51% for females) compared to the sedentary controls. Moreover, a peculiar metabolite (in particular, amino acids and urea), hormonal, and lipidic profile were highlighted in the two groups of athletes. Female and male adaptations to training have several common traits, such as antioxidant potential enhancement, lactate increase, and activation of detoxifying processes, such as the urea cycle and arachidonic pathways as a response to inflammation. Moreover, we found different lipid and amino acid utilization related to sex. Deeper investigation could help coaches in developing training programs based on the athletes’ sex in order to reduce the drop‐out rate of sporting activity by girls and fight the gender stereotypes in sport that also have repercussions in social fields. © 2022 by the authors.

During adolescence, its regular practice may contribute to the development of healthy adult lifestyles, decreasing chronic disease incidence. Therefore, the reasons that drive adolescents to start practicing sports in a certain club may be multiple and understanding such causes can be important to design and implement public policies to promote active lifestyles for everyone. In this article, we report the core findings of a research on why young athletes do sports, how they choose their team-training club and how COVID-19 has had an impact on their routines. From a methodological viewpoint, a questionnaire was developed and sent to sport clubs located in NUTS2 Centro Region, Portugal, and results were analyzed through the use of geographic information systems and statistical analysis, namely association tests (Chi-square test), difference tests (Mann–Whitney test and Kruskal–Wallis test), logistic regression and descriptive analysis. Findings show that family, age group, friends, proximity to sports facilities, teammates, and club conditions are the factors that influence adolescents the most. In short, external factors have a significant preponderance to practice physical activity and choose a sports’ club. These findings can provide useful insights for clubs, coaches and policy-makers to become more aware of the relationship between sports practice and accessibility to sports halls, as well as the athletes’ behavior and their connection with the club and basketball practice. As such, these findings can motivate the design of initiatives and strategies to boost sports practice and to find ways for clubs to attract more adolescents. © 2022 by the authors.

Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are recognized as the most important services for urban residents through the key of social interaction. Researchers commonly acknowledge the function of community sports parks to enhance social interaction. Nevertheless, existing studies generally do not pay enough attention to the influence mechanisms of community sports parks and social interaction, especially the different types of spaces in community sports parks, which could be due to the complex feature of social interaction. This paper selects three community sports parks in Chongqing as the case study, uses BBN to identify the influence mechanisms of three common types of spaces (fitness equipment space, path space, and sports court space) in community sports parks and social interaction, aiming to explore how community sports parks enhance social interaction. The results indicated that sports court space such as basketball court and badminton court enhanced social interaction best; however, the spaces farther away from the park entrances were generally less effective in enhancing interaction. All these three types of sports spaces showed the influence mechanism of “Spatial Factors-Activity Type-Social Interaction”, while differences existed in the specific spatial influencing factors. The findings highlight that based on the BBN obtained in this study, the threshold range of spatial factors could be adjusted to enhance the effect of community sports parks on social interaction. © 2022 by the authors.

Eight wheelchair basketball players from two teams were monitored during two games using an indoor position tracking system. Total distance, mean-and peak-speed, playing-time, number of sprints, sprints per minute, heart rate and rate of perceived exertion were recorded. Additionally, athletes with a lesion level above and below T6 were compared. No measured parameter differed between the games.

Descriptive statistics did not reveal differences between the groups with a lesion level below or above T6. In the present study, hot environmental conditions seemed not to have an impact on activity parameters of wheelchair basketball players. It was speculated that the game intensity and therefore metabolic heat production was too low; consequently, the athletes had a sufficient heat loss to prevent a decrease in performance during the play in hot conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

Twenty-four elite youth basketball players were randomly assigned to a training program including variable unilateral horizontal movements (VUH, n = 12) or unilateral lateral movements (VUL, n = 12). Eccentric-overload training (EOT) was performed twice a week for a six-week period. Functional performance assessment included a countermovement jump test, unilateral multidirectional jumping tests (i.e., lateral, horizontal, and vertical), a rebound jump test, a limb symmetry index, a 25 m linear sprint test, and several change of direction (COD) tests. Within-group analysis showed substantial improvements in almost all functional tests in both groups (ES = 0.35–0.89). Furthermore, almost all jumping asymmetries were improved in both groups (ES = 0.38–0.69) except for vertical jumping asymmetry in VUL (ES = −0.04). Between-group analyses showed a substantial and possibly better performance in vertical jumping asymmetry and 5 m in VUH compared to that of VUL, respectively. In contrast, lateral jumping with left (ES = 1.22) and right leg (ES = 0.49) were substantially greater in VUL than in VUH. Specific force-vector training programs induced substantial improvements in both functional performance tests and inter-limb asymmetries, although greater improvements of lateral and horizontal variables may depend on the specific force vector targeted. © 2022 by the authors.

This article is targeted at those involved with designing and implementing SRC guidelines in amateur sport. Design Scoping Review. Data Sources The SRC guidelines of 15 sporting organisations were accessed through public materials available from the official organisation website. Eligibility Criteria: To be included in this review, sports must enjoy broad participation by UK amateur athletes with a high risk of athletes sustaining an SRC. Results: 15 sporting organisations were included in this review with two, British Cycling and British Eventing, found not to have published SRC guidelines. There was found to be a large discrepancy between the extent to which the sport-specific guides followed the Berlin statement recommendations. Conclusions: The large discrepancy between the contents of the SRC guidelines may be putting the health of athletes at risk. We recommend the UK government publish standardised concussion guidelines based on the latest scientific research that must be used by all UK amateur sport groups. © 2022 by the authors.

Cross-sectional survey data from adults exiting a Brooklyn, NY, USA arena (Barclays, n = 464) with a 16-oz portion-size restriction and a Manhattan, NY, USA arena with no portion-size restriction (Madison Square Garden, control, n = 295) after the portion cap policy was put in place from March through June 2014 were analyzed. Linear regression models adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, race, marital status, education, and income were used to compare the two arenas during the post-implementation period. The survey response rate was 45.9% and equivalent between venues. Among all arena goers, participants at Barclays purchased significantly fewer SSB oz (−2.24 oz, 95% CI [−3.95, −0.53], p = .010) and consumed significantly fewer SSB oz (−2.34 oz, 95% CI[−4.01, −0.68], p = .006) compared with MSG after adjusting for covariates. Among those buying at least one SSB, Barclays’ participants purchased on average 11.03 fewer SSB oz.

There were no statistically significant differences between arenas in food calories and event satisfaction. In addition, no one reported not ordering a drink due to small size.

We hypothesized that students with the lowest burden of acute symptoms, measured in the first 72 h, would have the fastest return to school and sports and those with the highest burden of symptoms would have the slowest return to school and sports. This injury surveillance cohort included 808 athletes from 11 NCAA Division III colleges who sustained a concussion between 2014 and 2019. Athletic trainers documented time to return to school and to sports. Kruskal-Wallis tests with post-hoc planned comparison Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess whether athletes took longer to return based on their acute symptom burden (Low, Medium, or High). Survival analysis (Kaplan Meier with log rank tests) was used to compare the recovery times based on acute symptom burden (censored at 28 days). Chi-square tests compared the proportion of those who had not yet returned to school or sports at various recovery benchmarks (i.e., 1 week, 10 days, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks) based on acute symptom burden. Women (median = 5 days) took slightly longer than men (median = 4 days) to return to school (p = 0.001; r = −0.11, small effect). Women and men did not differ on time to return to sports (p = 0.32, r = −0.04). A greater proportion with high acute symptoms remained out of school at 5 (odds ratio, OR = 4.53), 7 (OR = 4.98), and 10 (OR = 4.80) days compared to those with low acute symptoms. A greater proportion with high acute symptoms remained out of sports at 10 (OR = 4.11), 14 (OR = 3.46), and 21 (OR = 3.01) days compared to those with low acute symptoms. This study shows a strong association between having a high burden of acute post-concussion symptoms and having a slower return to school and sports in Division III collegiate athletes. Moreover, it also illustrates the converse: that those athletes with a low burden of acute symptoms have a faster return to school and sports.

Purpose: To assess common sex- and age-based injury patterns in pediatric basketball players. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Injury data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) and participation data from the National Sporting Goods Association were used to complete this study. Data on pediatric basketball injuries between January 2012 and December 2018 in patients aged 7 to 11 years (childhood) and 12 to 17 years (adolescence) were extracted and used to calculate national injury incidence rates with 95% CIs. Sex and age group patterns were examined utilizing Pearson chi-square tests. Z tests were conducted for the comparison of injury rates between female and male athletes in each age group and overall injury rate across age groups. Results: An average of 9582 basketball injuries were reported annually in the NEISS, which calculated to an annual national estimate of 294,920 injuries. The most common diagnoses were ankle strain/sprain (17.7%), finger strain/sprain/fracture (12.1%), concussion/head injury (9.4%), knee strain/sprain (4.5%), and facial laceration (3.3%). There was a significant increase in injury prevalence in adolescents (12- to 17-year-old category: 238,678 injuries per year) when compared with childhood (7- to 11-year-old category: 56,242 injuries per year) (P <.0001). Concussions/head injuries occurred at a high rate in childhood, second only to finger strain/sprain/fracture, and at a similar rate in females and males (injuries per 100,000 athlete-days: 4.9 [95% CI, 3.1-6.7] vs. 5.9 [4.3-7.5], respectively; P =.41). From childhood to adolescence, injury prevalence increased for all areas and across both sexes, except for female finger strain/sprain/fracture; however, the rate of increase for concussion/head injuries and knee injuries was significantly higher in female compared with male athletes (P <.0001 for both). In adolescents, ankle injuries were the most common injury overall. Conclusion: Ankle injuries continue to be the most predominant pediatric basketball injury. However, disproportionate rates of both knee and concussion/head injuries in female athletes during adolescent basketball are of concern and have implications for injury prevention. © The Author(s) 2022.","adolescent; basketball; child; descriptive epidemiology; injury; recreation/sports","adolescent; ankle injury; ankle sprain; Article; basketball; basketball injury; child; concussion; cross-sectional study; emergency ward; female; finger fracture; head injury; human; knee injury; laceration; major clinical study; male; prevalence; school child; sport injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123262323

Purpose: To examine the prevalence of MRI findings, including BME, in a single male collegiate basketball team before and after a single season and to assess its association with clinically symptomatic metatarsal bone stress injuries. Study Design: Cohort Study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 16 men on a single collegiate basketball team (mean age, 20.0 ± 1.8 years) underwent 1.5-T MRI focused on both midfeet during the preseason, and 13 underwent repeat MRI during the postseason. MRI findings included the presence of BME and the radiographic classification of the bone stress injury (grades 1-4). Injury surveillance performed by athletic trainers was used to identify metatarsal bone stress injuries over the course of the season. Results: Preseason MRI demonstrated metatarsal BME in 5 of the 16 participants, and postseason MRI demonstrated metatarsal BME in 4 of the 13 participants.

Compared to those without BME, participants with metatarsal BME had a shorter history of basketball exposure (preseason: 10.4 ± 4.1 vs 14.2 ± 1.9 years, respectively [P =.023]; postseason: 9.6 ± 4.1 vs 14.0 ± 2.1 years, respectively [P =.024]), and those with postseason BME had started playing at an older age (9.8 ± 4.3 vs 6.2 ± 1.6 years, respectively; P =.050). The preseason MRI classification for metatarsals included grade 1 (n = 3), followed by grades 2 and 3 (n = 2 each). In the 4 participants with postseason MRI findings, the grade increased from 1 to 4 in 1 participant and was stable in the other 3. No participants were diagnosed clinically with a metatarsal bone stress injury during the season. BME of the sesamoids was identified in 6 participants, who trended toward being older (21.0 ± 2.2 vs 19.4 ± 1.3 years, respectively; P <.10), with the abnormalities persisting on postseason MRI in all players. Conclusion: Collegiate male basketball players may have a high prevalence of BME, often without associated symptoms. The absence of foot pain or a corresponding diagnosis of a metatarsal bone stress injury in this study suggests that MRI findings of BME in asymptomatic athletes should be interpreted with caution. © The Author(s) 2022.","athletes; basketball; injury; MRI; stress fractures","adult; age; Article; basketball player; bone injury; bone marrow edema; bone radiography; bone stress injury; clinical article; cohort analysis; disease classification; exposure; human; male; metatarsal bone; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; stress fracture; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123178680

The sport has changed dramatically since its inception. When the sport of cheerleading was first developed, its primary purpose was to entertain crowds and support other athletes. Today, cheerleaders are competitive athletes themselves. Cheerleaders, most of whom are in the pediatric age group, and their parents commonly approach orthopaedic surgeons and sports medicine physicians with questions regarding the risks associated with participation in the sport. Appropriate clinical guidance is especially important for athletes returning to the sport after an injury. However, unlike other popular sports (eg, football, basketball, and volleyball), the intricacies of cheerleading are not well-known to those outside the sport, including many health care providers. Previous studies have reported on the epidemiological patterns of injuries associated with cheerleading and how such aesthetic sports affect the body, finding that fractures and concussions are prevalent and that catastrophic injuries are more common than in most other sports. Here, we provide an evidence-based discussion of 10 pertinent topics regarding cheerleading and its risks to the musculoskeletal system. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive resource for orthopaedic surgeons and sports medicine physicians who care for these athletes. © The Author(s) 2022.","athlete; cheerleading; concussion; injuries; injury prevention; return to sport","athlete; bone density; cheerleader; concussion; female; football player; fracture; gymnastics; health benefit; health hazard; human; knee function; knee injury; lumbar spine; musculoskeletal injury; orthopedic surgeon; orthopedics; Review; shoulder injury; stunting; terminal disease; training",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123101326

Methods: Twelve male healthy collegiate basketball players (age: 22.8 ± 2.7 yrs, stature: 178.0 ± 5.1 cm, body mass: 74.5 ± 6.8 kg) volunteered to participate in this study. Data were collected utilizing a 3D motion analysis system, force plate, and surface electromyography. Field-goal percentage, the lowest point of the center of mass (CoM), the angles of joints during taking off phase and landing, and the electromyography parameters of the rectus femoris, erector spinae lumbalis, and of the lower limbs when performing CMJ and JS were recorded. Lower back muscle fatigue intervention was introduced and followed by a post-test to explore the effects of fatigue in the lower back muscles. Statistical analysis was performed using paired-samples t-test. Results: After lower back muscle fatigue, field-goal percentages dropped, and lowest point of CoM was increased during JS. Ankle plantar flexion of the hopping leg during CMJ and JS increased, and their knee flexion angles of the hopping leg were reduced when landing. CMJ and JS changed the contribution ratio of both legs after low back fatigue. Conclusions: Temporary low back muscles fatigue decreased the athletes' performance and causes a change in landing strategy. © 2022 Authors.

In fact, the number of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgeries performed annually has increased to over 100 000 and continues to increase (2). However, despite great progress made in ACLR research, many controversies and problems still remain (3). No clear consensus has been reached about the most suitable graft, femoral tunnel drilling technique and graft fixation method in ACLR (4). Besides this, the influence of ACLR on the progress of knee osteoarthritis is still in dispute (5). According to epidemiological studies, ACL tears are one of the most common and serious injuries in professional sports, especially basketball and soccer, with ACLR being the main treatment (6, 7). Despite progress in the past decades, ACLR has not been perfect enough to enable athletes to fully return to prior level of play without negative consequences. With a considerable morbidity and improvable surgical methods, ACLR has always been a focus of sports medicine. Currently, thousands of articles have been published regarding ACLR. While most of the articles involve clinical research or are reviews, few studies have attempted to statistically analyze the data of these publications. © 2022 The authors","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bibliometrics; Citespace; Frontiers; Hotspots; Vosviewer","ambulatory surgery; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bibliometrics; citation analysis; clinical research; graft size; hamstring muscle; human; international cooperation; joint surgery; knee arthroscopy; knee meniscus; knee surgery; medical literature; muscle graft; national health organization; patellar ligament; publication; return to sport; sports medicine; traumatology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85145848068

High-intensity training and competitiveness of the sports competition are perhaps critical causes of sports-related stress. This article reviews the relevant research on sports injuries and stressor-related disorders. Further, it explores the following three issues in depth: (1) Do physical injuries caused by competitive sports lead to acute or posttraumatic stress disorder for athletes? What are the abnormal stress responses? (2) What diagnoses are currently available for sports injury related traumatic stress disorder? (3) What kinds of psychological rehabilitation are available for trauma-related symptoms in sports injury? How efficient are they in alleviating these symptoms? Methods: The study searched electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, etc. And reference lists of included papers were also screened. Two researchers selected the literature strictly according to the inclusion criteria and sorted them out. Based on the proved conclusions, the study established a new framework to manage traumatic stress disorders after the injury occurred. Results: 16 articles were included in the study. (Q1: N = 10; Q2: N = 3; Q3: N = 3) The findings of this review suggested that athletes who suffer from sports injuries are more likely to experience abnormal physiological or psychological stress responses, which may become a massive challenge for athletes to continue their sports careers at a competitive level. However, there is a minimal understanding of addressing sports injury-related traumatic stress disorder from a biological perspective. Thus, it is challenging to build a scientific basis for diagnosis, screening, and treatment. In addition, the current diagnostic tool for athletes stress disorder still heavily relies on subjective measurement, and the treatment plan is not different from that of the general population. Conclusions: It highlighted that sports-related stress disorder could be the greatest challenge to return to competition for injured athletes. The present study indicated the importance of systematically identifying the symptoms of sports-related stress disorder and improving the current diagnosis and treatment system. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Participants were divided into an experimental group (n = 10; age, 14.80 ± 0.79 years; height, 163.80 ± 3.46 cm; weight, 55.90 ± 0.99 kg; training, 4.50 ± 0.53 years) and a control group (n = 10; age, 14.60 ± 0.70 years; height, 163.30 ± 3.47 cm; weight, 56.10 ± 0.74 kg; training, 4.30 ± 0.48 years). Reactive agility was assessed through a modified t-test, visual reaction time was assessed using the Li Lafayette instrument Visual Reaction Time Apparatus 63014 response panel, and dribbling skills were assessed through dribbling testing. The results showed improved agility through the modified agility t-test (11%; p = 0.001), an increased speed of visual reaction time for both the right and left hands (23–31%), and improved dribbling skills (19%; p = 0.001) for the experimental group using the FITLIGHT reactive agility software. The results also showed increased skills of the experimental group when compared to the control group. Differences in variability emerged between 6 and 14.1% in favor of the experimental group. Therefore, the researchers recommended that attention should be paid to activating the role of the FITLIGHT reactive agility training to improve and develop the physical, visual, and skill capabilities of basketball players. The researchers propose that FITLIGHT can be effectively used in the basketball training process. © 2022 by the authors.

Agility plays an essential role in basketball so increased agility needs to be a concern in the physical conditioning exercises of basketball players. To achieve the best results possible with an exercise, the type and manner of the exercise must be considered. The more varied is the training model offered to athletes, the more will it further encourage athletes not to feel exhausted while training. However, the training model used is still limited to hard textured courts. Though the use of textured fields such as water and sand has an impact other than power load, it lowers the rate of injury. Materials and methods. The method used in this study was a 2×2 factorial design experiment. This study involved 36 men's basketball athletes ages 16-18. The leg power instrument used a vertical jump, agility assessment used an agility test, and analysis of this study data used the ANOVA test. Results. (1) the sand exercise method shows higher results than the water exercise method; (2) athletes who have high limb power are better in agility testing than athletes who have low limb power; and (3) there is an interaction of water exercise and sand exercise methods and power of the limbs against agility. Conclusions. The results of this study could prove that sand exercise methods are more effectively used in increasing agility to be an alternative for coaches. © Salafi, M. I. E., Suherman, W.

Shear wave elastography (SWE) presents a relatively new means for non-invasive evaluation of soft tissue elasticity pre-and post-injury or intervention. Purpose (1) To establish baseline hamstring stiffness measures for young competitive athletes and (2) determine effect of targeted neuromuscular training (TNMT) on shear wave stiffness of the hamstring. Study Design Un-blinded, prospective, non-randomized, cohort study. Methods Six-hundred forty-two lower extremities from 321 high school and collegiate basketball athletes (177 F: 139 M) were examined for hamstring stiffness prior to the start of their competitive basketball season. Teams were cluster assigned to either the control or intervention (TNMT) group. Subjects in the control group underwent regular season activities as directed, with no influence from the research team. For the TNMT group, the research team introduced a hamstring targeted dynamic warm-up program as an intervention focused on activating the hamstring musculature. Results Collegiate status was significant to hamstring stiffness for both sexes (p ≤ 0.02), but hamstring stiffness did not correlate to age or sex (r2 ≤ 0.08). Intervention was a significant factor to hamstring stiffness when the hip was positioned in extension (p ≤ 0.01), but not in deeper flexion (p = 0.12). This effect was sex-specific as TNMT influenced hamstring stiffness in females (p = 0.03), but not in males (p ≥ 0.13). Control athletes suffered three HAM injuries; TNMT athletes suffered 0 hamstring injuries. Conclusion Higher SWE measurements correlated with increased risk of injury, male sex, and collegiate athletics. TNMT intervention can lessen muscle stiffness which may reduce relate to injury incidence. Intervention effectiveness may be sex specific.

Therefore, it is imperative to screen, identify, and educate athletes who are at high-risk. The combination of screening and education could identify those at risk and potentially reduce future injuries. Purpose The purpose was to conduct a feasible community pre-season screening program for high school female athletes for the presence of known modifiable risk factors that predispose them to sustaining a non-contact ACL injury. Study Design Non-experimental prospective study Methods A convenience sample of 15 healthy female athletes were recruited from local high schools, consisting of 11 soccer players and four basketball players. A pre-season screening program was designed encompassing four stations that addressed modifiable neuromuscular and biomechanical risk factors including range of motion (ROM), jump-landing technique, strength, and balance. Athletes were categorized into high-risk versus low-risk groups based on cutoff scores previously established in the literature. Results Every athlete met the high-risk cutoff score for at least one extremity during the ROM screening, and some met high-risk cutoff scores for more than one ROM. Out of all four categories tested, lower extremity ROM demonstrated the greatest deficits. Conclusion This study identified athletes as having multiple modifiable risk factors that can be addressed with training and exercises. This supports implementing a pre-season program aimed at screening for injury risk factors. Level of Evidence Level 3. © 2022, North American Sports Medicine Institute.

The right knee exam demonstrated minimal swelling, decreased range of motion secondary to pain, and generalized tenderness. A radiograph of the right knee revealed a tibial spine fracture. Discussion: Tibial spine fractures are avulsion fractures of the spine of the tibia at the insertion site of the anterior cruciate ligament. The incidence of avulsion fractures is higher in adolescents because the region of the apophyseal growth plate between the soft-tissue attachment site and the body of the bone is weaker in that age group. Tibial spine avulsion fractures are relatively uncommon and occur annually in approximately three per 100,000 children.

Clinical assessments included electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram at the initial admission and follow-up were compared. Treadmill testing was also performed in some cases. Between 14 June 2021 and 16 February 2022, 53 subjects were approached to participate in this follow-up study, of which 28 patients were followed up for >60 days with a median follow-up period of 100 days (range, 61–178 days) and were included in this study. On admission, 23 patients had ECG abnormalities but no high-grade atrioventricular block. Six patients had echocardiogram abnormalities, including reduced contractility, small rim pericardial effusions, and hyperechoic ventricular walls. All patients achieved complete recovery on follow-up. After discharge, 10 patients (35.7%) reported symptoms, including occasional chest pain, shortness of breath, reduced exercise tolerance, and recurrent vasovagal near-syncope. At follow-up, assessments, including ECGs, were almost all normal. Among the three patients with possible ECG abnormalities, all their echocardiograms or treadmill testings were normal. Sixteen patients (57.1%) underwent treadmill testing at a median of 117 days post-admission, which were also normal. However, at follow-up, there was a significant mean bodyweight increase of 1.81 kg (95%CI 0.47-3.1 kg, p = 0.01), possibly due to exercise restriction. In conclusion, most adolescents experiencing myocarditis and pericarditis following BNT162b2 vaccination achieved complete recovery. Some patients developed non-specific persistent symptoms, and bodyweight changes shall be monitored. © 2022 The Author(s).

At the same time, these are sports of higher achievements (top sport), sports entertainment is an important mean of active rest (recreation) and, of course, one of the most powerful means of physical education. The popularity of sports games is especially pronounced among school children and youth. In addition to compulsory physical education classes, they are widely represented in free sports activities. As it is known among other anthropological dimensions, cognitive abilities have a significant impact in achieving top results in sports. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between a set of predictor variables of cognitive abilities and a set of criterion variables of situational motor abilities in sports games, especially in volleyball in primary school boys. By analyzing the corresponding canonical functions in the space of cognitive abilities, the function is defined by all variables, as well as by another set of data, the function is defined by all situational motor variables. As all cognitive abilities are in direct proportionality with the results of situational motor skills tests, it can be concluded that subjects with higher spatialisation ability and higher IQ will have good results in specific motor, especially in volleyball. These results are logical considering the structure of performing exercises from sports games especially volleyball, which require good coordination of movements, which is directly related to cognitive abilities. © 2022, Institute for Human Rehabilitation.

Methods: The research involved 96 female students aged 17-23 years forming the experimental (EG, n = 54) and control (CG, n = 42) groups. The female students of EG played basketball in the conditions of group physical education training sessions using the exercise machines developed by us, and the female students of the CG were engaged in basketball playing according to the traditional program without the use of developed exercise machines and had an initial level of basketball technique. The EG was divided into EG1 (n = 37) and EG2 (n = 17) subgroups, which included female students having initial and high levels of basketball technique mastery, respectively. Female basketball players with an initial level of training (EG1 and СG) had experience of up to 3 years, athletes with a high level of training (EG2)-playing experience of more than 10 years. The technology of technical equipment application in basketball is built on the basis of the use of designed portable exercise machines to implement the tasks of motor and technical training of female basketball players of different levels of training. Results The results of the conducted experiment showed that the accuracy of throws from the average distance increased by 40.9% and 29.4% in the EG1 and EG2 female students, and it grew by 9.9% in the CG; from the long distance – by 61.5%, 37.0% and 31.3% respectively; the level of development of speed and strength qualities of female students of all groups improved i. e. the rate of growth in the results of the long jump made 9.7%, 3.2% and 6.5%, respectively; the rate of growth in the results of the high jump made 20.0%, 6.3% and 8.7%, respectively. Conclusion: Experimental testing of the technology of using designed exercise machines for the development of motor skills of female basketball students confirmed its effectiveness in terms of improving the spatial and dynamic accuracy of movement, speed and strength, as well as game performance of basketball players at competitions of various levels. © 2022 Tymoshenko et al.","Accuracy of ballthrow; and strength quality; Basketball; Exercise machines; Female students; Speed; Technical equipment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139524294

We recruited 30 young basketball players to participate in four weeks of training and assessments. They were randomized into the WBV resistance training group (VRTG, n=15) and a conventional resistance training group (RTG, n=15), performed 3 times per week. At the beginning and end of the four weeks a back squat one-repetition maximum (1RMBS), Countermovement jump (CMJ), Squat jump (SJ), 10 meters (10m) and 20 meters sprint (20m) were performed. We found that: a) VRTG when added to RT can induce greater improvements in 1RMBS (percentage difference [PD], 8.4%, p < 0.001), CMJ (PD = 4.7%, p = 0.001) and SJ (PD = 1.6, p = 0.02) than RT alone. In contrary, significant time*group interactions were found for sprint times at 10m (p=0.08, F=3.2) and 20m (p=0.17, F=1.93). An additional 4-week WBV resistance training program proved effective in improving lower limb power and strength in young basketball players. When performed on a vibration platform (with accurate and constant vibration stimulus parameters), the resistance exercises were superior to their conventional forms and resulted in additional gains on measures of muscle power and strength, while sprint performance remained unchanged. © 2022 by the author(s).

However, with the development of China's Health Strategy, modern sports such as badminton and basketball occupy most of the people's time. On the contrary, there is much less exercise for traditional Chinese sports. Therefore, this paper aims to study Chinese traditional sports under China's Health Strategy and explore its cultural soft power. In this study, participants of all ages in different regions were selected for survey research. Combined with the survey results, the soft power index model of Chinese traditional sports culture is designed. The experimental results showed that for Chinese traditional cultural projects, the cultural soft power index of chui wan was the lowest at 0.568, and the highest was 0.982 in the dragon boat culture soft power index. For each evaluation index, the cultural cognition and cultural attractiveness of Chinese traditional sports were high, but the cultural behavioral power was low. This shows that the soft power model of Chinese traditional sports culture based on the healthy China strategic environment can effectively evaluate the development of traditional Chinese sports, which also can provide suggestions for the development and inheritance of traditional Chinese sports. © 2022 Fangyan Yang and Jisheng Zhang.",,"adult; article; China; cognition; female; human; human experiment; inheritance; male; sport; China; exercise; questionnaire; China; Exercise; Humans; Sports; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137713437

In sports competitions, athletes not only need to have superb skills but also need a strong psychological quality. Usually, athletes with high psychological quality can make their technical level outstanding; on the contrary, for athletes with low psychological quality, even if the level of competition is very high, it is difficult to achieve excellent results. This study analyzes the data of basketball players to study the influence of the stability of different players' psychological quality on the performance of basketball games. The ""mental state""of basketball players is negatively correlated with their performance in basketball games, and the players' psychology often shows signs of tension during basketball games.

Basketball is one of the most practiced situational sports in physical education hours in schools. However, it is still mostly teaching according to a traditional, prescriptive-based model. The aim of the study was to compare prescriptive teaching with ecological-dynamic learning for improving shooting accuracy in a group of 3rd year high school students. METHODS The sample is made up of 32 students (16 ± 0.72) divided into 2 groups: Group A, consisting of 16 students who were administered a training protocol based on the ecological-dynamic approach, and Group B, consisting of 16 students, who followed a cognitive approach. The undershot test was administered in and out to test the students’ level of shooting accuracy. A t test for paired dependent samples and for independent samples were performed to compare two groups and to verify which of them had the greater improvement. Data were analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS The results were statistically significant in group A (p &lt; 0.05); infact, group A had a greater improvement in shooting accuracy than group B.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the IWBF functional classification for wheelchair basketball was related to different performance field-based tests. Forty wheelchair basketball athletes took part in the study. The players carried out five field tests, three of which were quantitative, related to the three conditional skills (strength, endurance and speed test) and two of the qualitative type (accuracy and shooting ability tests). Pearson’s correlation was performed to analyse the correlation between the score obtained from functional classification and the results of the wheelchair performance tests. The IWBF class was not correlated (p <0.05) with any of the tests performed. Players with even major injuries, in their best wheelchair set-up, even achieved better times than upper-class players; therefore, the disability factor in these tests is not an index that determines performance disadvantage. The study shows that the functional classification does not affect the qualitative-quantitative performance, so the disabled athlete with a lower score is not disadvantaged in basketball. © 2022 Masaryk University.

The reform and development of education are always related closely to the growth of scientific and technological development, and people's physical education training methods are also undergoing subtle changes. The traditional single and formulaic training methods in the past have gradually turned to modern training methods with better interaction and visibility. All of this prompts people to have new requirements on sports training concepts and training modes. On this basis, teachers can conduct virtual teaching in a more interactive, more involved, and orderly manner in the virtual classroom. This paper constructs the implementation framework of VR basketball teaching auxiliary training, divides students into an experimental group and a control group and tests the physical fitness of students before and after the experiment. The students' basic basketball skills were tested by using embedded intelligent sensors to recognize the students' movements. The experimental results showed that after the test, the four basic basketball skills scores of the students in the experimental group were 68.78, 74.02, 73.13, and 72.34, respectively.

A method of cultivating the ring tone of juvenile basketball is proposed. This method is based on Chan algorithm. When the target is close to each base station, the first estimation also needs an initial value to solve the initial solution estimation matrix. The method is also based on multivariate Taylor algorithm, taking into account the measured distance between the targets to be measured, so it will get some useful information, which will improve the positioning accuracy. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the algorithm used in this paper is more than 85%. However, the accuracy of rebounding and passing recognition and prediction is low. The recognition accuracy and prediction accuracy of the test set are slightly lower than that of the effective set, which shows that the performance of the target detection system model in this paper can be further improved through more significant training examples.

Methods: Seven public schools in Duque de Caxias (Brazil) were randomized into control and intervention groups. The intervention group underwent modifications in the school environment (painting of hopscotch and school courts) and the provision of sports equipment (balls, basketball table, soccer goalpost, volleyball nets, and others) to stimulate physical activity. Additionally, footsteps towards the court and materials were painted, and a superhero character called Super Active was introduced. Total physical activity was measured using a validated questionnaire for adolescents. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the effect of the intervention, adjusted by sex. Results: The sample consisted of 975 adolescents, with a mean age of 11.52 years (standard deviation — SD 1.43), and 56.7% were boys. After the one-month intervention, both groups’ total physical activity time increased. The estimated changes from baseline were not different between the intervention and control groups (∆=102.75 and ∆=99.76, respectively; p=0.52). Conclusion: The painting, supply of equipment and other strategies to encourage physical activity in the school environment did not promote a positive effect on improving physical activity among adolescents.

Material and Methods: This research is experimental research with a “Two Groups Pretest-Posttest” design that includes a pre-test before the subjects are given treatment and a post-test after the treatment. The research populations were twenty male athletes from a basketball club in Yogyakarta, selected using a random sampling technique. All samples were subjected to a pre-test to determine the treatment group, ranked by their pre-test scores, then matched with the A-B-B-A pattern in two groups with ten athletes each. The sampling technique used in this dividing step was ordinal pairing. This research was conducted 18 times in treatment. The instrument used was an agility test using the Lane agility test. The movements for each number are as follows, (1) Sprint, stunt step, (2) Right slide (running with a guard position to the right side), (3) Run backwards, (4) Left slide, (5) Right slide, (6) Sprint, stunt step, pivot, (7) Right slide, (8) Sprint. Results: The research used normality, homogeneity, and hypothesis testing. To test the hypothesis, the researchers used the two types of t-tests, namely paired sample test and the independent sample test. The T-test is a statistical analysis technique that can be used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two sample means or not. The results revealed that the t count was 2,335 with a p significance value of 0.031. Because the t-count was 2.335 and the significance value was <0.05, these results indicated a significant difference. Conclusions: There was a significant difference in the effect of the exercise methods (water exercise and sand exercise) on agility.

It is important to know that basketball requires programs based on speed, agility and strength fitness components, in which endurance and strength parameters are predominant. In this context, resistance training, which provides skill excellence and increased muscle strength, is important for basketball players. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of 4-week specific core training applied to preadolescent and adolescent children who do basic basketball training on explosive strength. Material and Methods A total of 16 [Control Group (CG): n=8; Experimental Group (EG): n=8] individuals (age 13.29 ± 1.96 years) who did not have any health problems from basketball school and continued basketball basic training were included in the study. The groups continued their usual basketball basic training program (2 days a week, 60 minutes a day). However, in addition to the basic training program, the experimental group was subjected to an isometric training program for 12-minute core strengthening. Training programs were made for a total of 4 weeks. We examined the effects of core training on speed, vertical jump and agility parameters. Statistical analyzes of the data obtained as a result of the research were obtained using the IBM SPSS 23.0 package program. Results There was no difference between the groups for sprint and vertical jump parameters of core and basic basketball training (p>0.05). However, there was a significant difference in favor of EG in the agility test analysis results (p<0.05). As a result, we can say that 4-week core training applied in addition to the basic basketball training program in children improves agility characteristics. Conclusions The findings showed that core training programs have positive effects on explosive strength parameters. In addition, strengthening the core area significantly improved the agility parameter, which is important in ground-direction changes. This, in parallel with the studies, supported that core training programs should be an integral part of other training programs. This study also showed that core stabilization training applied in a short time improves explosive strength parameters in children. © Nurkan Yılmaz, 2022.","basketball; biomotoric parameters; children; core strength",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134510702

However, basketball generally has the problem of unreasonable sports schemes and even reduces physical fitness. Therefore, finding an effective basketball program is an urgent problem to be solved at present. In order to improve the level of public health, this paper proposes a correlation analysis method to study the impact of basketball on teenagers' health. The correlation analysis method is used to analyze the health data of adolescents, combined with the influence of basketball on fitness and the characteristics of basketball itself. Previous studies on basketball neglected comprehensive analysis and lack of correlation analysis of basketball indexes, resulting in unsatisfactory analysis results. The correlation analysis method can adjust the technical method, intensity, and program of basketball in combination with the physical development of teenagers. MATLAB simulation shows that the correlation analysis method can accurately analyze the impact of basketball on teenagers' health, with an accuracy of 95%. Therefore, the correlation analysis method constructed in this paper can provide guidance for basketball and improve the health level of teenagers. © 2022 Xinbo Shao and Yuwei Sun.",,"adolescent; article; basketball; controlled study; correlation analysis; data analysis software; fitness; health data; human; intermethod comparison; physical development; public health; simulation; exercise; fitness; health status; Adolescent; Basketball; Exercise; Health Status; Humans; Physical Fitness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133630102

The kinematics of the ball affects the shot accuracy. The main purposes of this study are to compare the kinematics of the ball according to the outcomes of WB and basketball players’ shots and compare the shooting accuracy of WB and basketball players. Male senior athletes (17 basketball, 6 WB) voluntarily participated in the research. Participants made static shots from 6 spots (n=1515) and the analyses were made. The shots were separated into 4 groups. The first group contained the “Clean Shot”s (CS) which the ball goes into the hoop with no or 1 hit to the rim. The second contained all the “Success” shots (S) but CS. The third contained “Missed” shots, the ball hit to the rim. Fourth contained the rest of the missed shots (Air Ball). Reliable and valid 94fifty Smart Sensor Basketball was used in this research. For both WB and basketball players, CS angles were significantly higher than other shots and no significant difference was found between S angles and unsuccessful shots. CS angles of WB players were significantly higher than basketball players. This research showed that the entry angle affects CS for both sports. It is thought that it may raise CS and shooting percentage if coaches train their players by taking entry angles into consideration. Another finding of this study was CS angles of WB players are higher than basketball players. The reason for this may be the more active, hence more improved, upper extremity motor skills of the WB players. © 2022 Özdalyan et al.","94fifty; ball trajectory; Basketball; kinematics; shooting accuracy; Shooting angle; wheelchair basketball",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133608160

A significant negative correlation was observed between the free-throw accuracy and mean pre-shot time, suggesting that participants with a shorter pre-shot time showed a higher free-throw accuracy. In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between the free-throw accuracy and variability of angular velocity of the hip at the time of ball release, indicating that the consistency of hip movement is an important factor in free-throw accuracy. In contrast, there were no relationship between the free-throw accuracy and player’s classification point defined as International Wheelchair Basketball Federation, and experience of wheelchair basketball.

Experimental approach to the problem required the following tests/devices: a portable Metabolimeter was used to assess the metabolic parameters for each RC, Squat Jump (OptoJump) to assess the strength’s decrease differences of the lower limbs before/after each test and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) after each RC to assess the training load, while the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS-IMU) was used to assess the body inclinations and Acceleration/Deceleration for each RC. The T-test was used for independent samples and Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the significant differences for each variable between each RC. The results of this study could be useful not only for coaches to optimize basketball training load related to the RC (with and without the ball), but also to optimize the motor learning in young basketball players and to optimize the load of work in relation to the position and energetic capacities of players.

Objective: The aim of the study was quantitative assessment of diet depending on the level of generalised self- efficacy among elite Polish basketball players. Material and Methods: Food diaries (2 training days and 1 no training day) of 48 basketball players were analysed. Further assessed were 144 food rations based on the Diet 6.0 program, and the results were compared to the current Polish nutritional standards. The Generalised Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) was also used. Statistical analyses were performed by estimating Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (p<0.05). Results: The share of energy from proteins, fats and carbohydrates was 18.2%, 29.4% and 52.4%, respectively. Of the mineral salts, the average diet contained: 2,107.6 mg sodium, 2,918.3 mg potassium, 736.3 mg calcium, 1,372.2 mg phosphorus, 380.1 mg magnesium, and 11.6 mg iron. Of the vitamins, the average diet contained: 1,100.3 μg of vitamin A, 5.3 μg of vitamin D, vitamin E in the amount of 8.2 mg, 78.1 mg of vitamin C, 1.1 mg vitamin B1, 1.3 mg vitamin B2, 1.9 mg of vitamin B6, 271.7 μg of vitamin B9 and 4.7 μg of vitamin B12. It was also shown that as the sense of self-efficacy developed, the supply of energy, water, protein, digestible carbohydrates, energy from carbohydrates, sucrose and PUFAs also increased in the players' diets. At the same time, along with the increase in self-efficacy, the supply of: Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Cu and iodine as well as vitamins: A, E, B1, B3, B6 and C, also increased in the players' diets.

Basketball requires specific physical characteristics such as high stature, which raises the position of the center of gravity, making the stability angle smaller. This compromises stability, especially in sudden speed and direction chan-ges, because it requires a large base opening. The core musculature is intimately involved with body balance; however, there is a lack of studies verifying the impact of specific training of this region on balance in basketball athletes. Objective: To explore the influence of core strengthening on the physical fitness of college basketball players. Methods: 12 college basketball players were selected and randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. The experimental group performed core strengthening training, while the control group practiced traditional strength training. After six weeks, physical fitness and basic skills were compared between the groups. Data were statistically treated and discussed confronting the literature. Results: Basketball players in the experimental group obtained higher fast dribbling passes and shots than before the experiment (P<0.05), there was no statistically significant difference in several indicators in the control group ( P>0.05); Basketball players in the experimental group had higher fast dribbling passes and shots than the control group (P<0.05), there was no statistically significant difference in approach height between the experimental group and the control group (P>0.05).

This study examined the influence of shoe bending stiffness on lower extremity energetics in the take-off phase of consecutive jump. Methods. Fifteen basketball and volleyball players wearing control shoes and stiff shoes performed consecutive jumps. Joint angle, angular velocity, moments, power, jump height, take-off velocity, take-off time, and peak vertical ground reaction force data were simultaneously captured by motion capture system and force platform. Paired t-tests were performed on data for the two shoe conditions that fit the normal distribution assumptions, otherwise Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results. There are significant differences (P<0.05) in take-off velocity and take-off time between stiff and control shoe conditions; the stiff shoes had faster take-off velocity and shorter take-off time than control shoes. There was no significant difference between two conditions in jump height (P=0.512) and peak vertical ground reaction force (P=0.589). The stiff shoes had significantly lower MTP dorsiflexion angle and greater joint work than the control shoes (P<0.05). The MTP range of motion and maximum angular velocity in stiff shoe condition were significantly lower than those in control shoe condition (P<0.01). However, there are no significant differences between two conditions in kinetics and kinematics of the ankle, knee, and hip joint. Conclusions. The findings suggest that wearing stiff shoes can reduce the effect of participation of the MTP joint at work and optimize the energy structure of lower-limb movement during consecutive jumps. © 2022 Sheng-Wei Jia et al.",,"Biophysics; Joints (anatomy); Normal distribution; Physiological models; Sports; Stiffness; Wear of materials; Bending stiffness; Condition; Ground reaction forces; Joint angle; Lower extremity; Power; Take off; Take off time; Takeoff velocities; Volleyball players; Angular velocity; ankle; Article; basketball player; controlled study; energy transfer; ground reaction force; height; hip; human; joint characteristics and functions; jumping; kinematics; kinetics; knee; lower limb; major clinical study; rigidity; velocity; volleyball",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131415006

The technical and tactical features are analyzed using an improved Apriori algorithm for association rule analysis of basketball game data. The algorithm generates association rules based on mining the set of frequent items among basketball technical actions. The improved algorithm can mine the technical moves that are more connected in the game data, and the analysis results are highly instructive. The technical and tactical directed analysis is divided into two parts: technical and tactical directed action analysis and technical and tactical directed cooperation analysis. The key action analysis uses Markov process-based data mining algorithm to analyze the basketball game data for key score transfer steps and key score loss transfer steps. The algorithm can find the key actions of scoring and key actions of conceding points in the game process, and the analysis results can guide basketball training and games, which has high practical value. Using the collated game data as the independent variable and the number of games won and lost as the dependent variable, logistic regression analysis is applied to derive the characteristics that affect winning. Again, the decision tree algorithm is used to select the significant features that affect winning and to make predictions of team performance. Finally, the technical statistics of the main players in the last three seasons are selected, and the association rule algorithm is applied to derive the degree of influence of player performance on the outcome of the game. © 2022 Jian Zeng and Bao Jia.",,"Association rules; Data mining; Decision trees; Logistic regression; Markov processes; Sports; Action analysis; Apriori algorithms; Basketball games; Decisions makings; Game-Based; Improved apriori algorithms; In-depth analysis; Key actions; Multi-attributes; Tacticals; Learning algorithms; Apriori algorithm; article; basketball; data mining; decision making; decision tree; dependent variable; human; independent variable; Markov chain; mining; prediction; punishment; season",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131211667

An AR algorithm based on dynamic target tracking under VSLAM is proposed. The algorithm can effectively reject dynamic targets in static scenes while ensuring that the virtual objects registered based on dynamic template target tracking are still in the world coordinate system of VSLAM. To facilitate patients' hand function rehabilitation training, this paper uses OpenPose for 2D gesture pose recognition, combines camera pose information and depth information provided by VSLAM to map key points of the hand into the world coordinate system, and then completes the interaction by collision detection algorithm. The virtual interaction module is implemented in this paper to meet the demand for multiuser off-site interaction in virtual training. This paper uses the Unity3D software and Photon Server server to create a VR virtual scene and design a user interaction mechanism to realize a system that supports multiple users to train together online, which effectively extends the application scope of the VR training system. The module utilizes Unity3D's VR development capabilities to develop VR virtual basketball gym scenes and single-player offline interaction mechanisms such as virtual user single shooter and shooter; then, Photon Server is used to design and implement a multiuser remote login system and a multiuser interpass mechanism, thus achieving the effect of multiplayer remote online interaction in the same VR space. Finally, the proposed module was validated, and the results proved the effectiveness of the sports rehabilitation training program. © 2022 Huijun Yan.",,"algorithm; human; occupational therapy; technology; upper limb; virtual reality; Algorithms; Humans; Occupational Therapy; Technology; Upper Extremity; Virtual Reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130316105

Given these, this study aimed to investigate the effect of the intervention of wheelchair basketball on urinary tract infection in people with motor disabilities. METHODS: A 12-month experimental follow-up was conducted in a single-center study. A total of 48 male individuals aged 18–55 years were allocated to the control group and experimental group. The experimental group practiced wheelchair basketball for 2 h, twice a week. Intra- and intergroup comparisons were made pre- and post-interventions over urinary tract infection. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in urinary tract infection and urine culture in pre- and post-intervention antibiograms, respectively. Moreover, the intergroup comparison presented a decrease in infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as an increase in the time variability of partially activated thromboplastin, average corpuscular hemoglobin, and hemoglobin and platelets. In the experimental group, there was an increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit and a decrease in glycated hemoglobin (%HbA1C). On the intragroup comparison, there was a reduction of triiodothyronine (T3), %HbA1C, interleukin-6 pre-intervention, and C-reactive protein post-intervention. CONCLUSIONS: There was a decrease in urinary tract infection and improvement in biochemical, immunological, and microbiological biomarkers evaluated with physical exercise practice by wheelchair basketball, as well as by multiprofessional follow-up and health guidance. © 2022 Associacao Medica Brasileira.

Haglund's syndrome is a posterosuperior calcaneal prominence with posterior heel pain causing functional disability to the patient. Operative treatment is indicated after failure of conservative measures and includes resection of the bony hump along with retrocalcaneal bursectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the functional outcome and degree of patient satisfaction after endoscopic resection of Haglund's deformity with assessment of correlation with the length of bony exostosis. Methods. Seventeen patients (21 feet) with a mean age of 44.7 ± 5.1 years were included in this study. Six females and 11 males underwent endoscopic calcaneoplasty. Clinical outcome evaluation included the assessment of the visual analog scale (VAS) and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score (AOFAS). The preoperative and postoperative lengths of bony exostosis were measured radiologically. The paired t test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared the preoperative and final postoperative means. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results. The mean follow-up period was 56.4 ± 5.1 months. Statistically significant improvements in the preoperative mean of AOFAS (from 55.7 ± 9.3 to 94.3 ± 7.1) and VAS (from 8.1 ± 1.4 to 0.7 ± 1.04) at the final follow-up were noted P<0.0001. There was a statistically significant correlation between clinical scores (AOFAS and VAS) and the final postoperative length of the bone above parallel pitch lines (PPLs). The patients were satisfied and returned to their previous activities without reporting major morbidities except one patient who had mild pain with exertion. Conclusion. Endoscopic calcaneoplasty is a safe, less invasive surgical procedure for the management of Haglund's syndrome after failure of conservative treatment. It provided a satisfactory clinical result without serious complications at a minimum 4-year follow-up. © 2022 Hossam Fathi Mahmoud et al.",,"cefotaxime; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; achilles tendinitis; achilles tendon; adult; agricultural worker; American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot score; anamnesis; Article; basketball; bone resection; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; conservative treatment; employee; endoscopic calcaneoplasty; endoscopic surgery; exercise; exostosis; factory worker; female; follow up; football player; Haglund deformity; heel pain; housewife; human; male; measurement; occupation; outcome assessment; pain; passive movement; patient satisfaction; physical examination; physiotherapy; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; prone position; provocation test; rest; shock wave therapy; thrombocyte rich plasma; treatment failure; visual analog scale; weight bearing; X ray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129258761

To solve this big problem, combined with the latest research results of deep learning in the field of computer technology, based on the related technology of human posture recognition, this paper uses convolution neural network and video processing technology to create an auxiliary evaluation system of sports movements, which can obtain accurate data and help people interact with each other, so as to help athletes better understand their body posture and movement data. The research results show that: (1) using OpenPose open-source library for pose recognition, joint angle data can be obtained through joint coordinates, and the key points of video human posture can be identified and calculated for easy analysis. (2) The movements of the human body in the video are evaluated. In this way, it is judged whether the action amplitude of the detected target conforms to the standard action data. (3) According to the standard motion database created in this paper, a formal motion auxiliary evaluation system is established; compared with the standard action, the smaller the Euclidean distance is, the more standard it is. The action with an Euclidean distance of 4.79583 is the best action of the tested person. (4) The efficiency of traditional methods is very low, and the correct recognition rate of the method based on BP neural network can be as high as 96.4%; the correct recognition rate of the attitude recognition method based on this paper can be as high as 98.7%, which is 2.3% higher than the previous method. Therefore, the method in this paper has great advantages. The research results of the sports action assistant evaluation system in this paper are good, which effectively solves the difficult problems that plague athletes and can be considered to have achieved certain success; the follow-up system test and operation work need further optimization and research by researchers. © 2022 Qi Wang and Qing-Ming Wang.",,"Deep learning; Engineering education; Neural networks; Video signal processing; Computer technology; Convolution neural network; Euclidean distance; Field equipment; Human posture recognition; Movement datum; Neural-network processing; Research results; Standard action; Technology-based; Sports; adult; Article; athlete; attitude; back propagation neural network; basketball; body position; body regions; controlled study; convolutional neural network; edge detection; elbow; follow up; head; hip; human; image processing; knee; motion; movement (physiology); neck; running; shoulder; sport; support vector machine; swimming; videorecording; wrist; algorithm; athlete; movement (physiology); sport; Algorithms; Athletes; Humans; Movement; Neural Networks, Computer; Posture; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126882206

Ten professional basketball players were monitored during 11 matches using a local positioning system. Peak physical demands were measured via total distance, distance &gt;18 and &gt;21 km h-1, number of sprints &gt;18 and &gt;21 km h-1, and number of accelerations and decelerations &gt;2 and &gt;3 m s-2 captured over 30, 60, 120, 180, and 300-s rolling averages. Linear mixed models and effect sizes (ES) were used to compare MDS encountered between game quarters and playing positions. Between Quarters 1 and 2, there was a reduction in the total distance (ES = 0.64-1.39) for all playing groups along with a reduction in distance &gt;21 km h-1 in centres (ES = 0.77-0.81) and a reduction in accelerations and decelerations &gt;2 m s-2 in guards (ES = 0.66-0.78) across longer sample periods (180-300-s). Between Quarters 1 and 4, reductions in the total distance were evident for forwards and centres (ES = 0.64-0.91) as well as distance and sprints &gt;21 km h-1 in centres (ES = 0.64-0.97). Regarding positional differences, guards and forwards covered a higher total distance than centres across most quarters and sample periods (ES = 0.22-1.44). Our data suggest a decrease in MDS with game progression in basketball. In addition, MDS appear to be duration-specific and position-dependent in basketball. Therefore, practitioners should consider these differences in MDS based on game quarters and positional demands to optimise individual and team performance. © 2022 by the author(s).

However, no research has explored the effects of athlete chronotype on basketball-specific skills at different times of the day. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore diurnal variations in basketball shooting accuracy according to chronotype. Professional, male basketball players (n = 13) completed a Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and were categorised into chronotypes using a tertile split technique (morning-types: n = 4; neither-types: n = 4; evening-types: n = 5). Players completed separate trials of a shooting accuracy test in the morning (08:00-09:30h) and afternoon (15:00-16:30h) with each trial consisting of 20 shots attempted from four court locations at either two- or three-point distances and one-shot location from the free-throw line (100 shots in total). Each shot attempt was scored using a 0-3-point scale with higher scores awarded to more accurate shots. Non-significant (p >0.05) differences in shooting scores were evident between morning and afternoon trials for each chronotype group, with small-large effects in shooting scores favouring the morning across groups. Moreover, non-significant (p >0.05) differences in shooting scores were apparent between chronotype groups in the morning (small-large effects) and afternoon (moderate-large effects). Shooting accuracy appears to remain consistent across morning and afternoon performances irrespective of player chronotype in a professional basketball team, suggesting coaches may not need to schedule training sessions involving shooting tasks at specific times of the day to optimise shooting accuracy in players. © 2022 Brazilian Association of Sleep and Latin American Federation of Sleep Societies.

It is suggested that neuromuscular training could improve dynamic postural balance and proprioception in basketball players with functional ankle instability (FAI). Method: Randomized controlled clinical trial. The sample consisted of 27 female basketball players between the ages of 15 and 17, belonging to a Sports Club in the Maipú city (Santiago, Chile). 13 of them assigned to the control group and 14 to an experimental group. This last group received a neuromuscular intervention of 6 weeks, of 2 non-consecutive days. Both extremities were worked on stable, unstable surfaces, with and without visual inhibition. Postural balance was measured with the SEBTm test and proprioception through an active joint repositioning test. Results: both the control and experimental groups significantly improved postural balance, however, the experimental group showed greater percentage changes and larger effect sizes (ES).The greatest change in the control group was 7.8% in the posterolateral direction of the SEBTm (p=0.046; ES=0.74). In the experimental group, the greatest change was 21% in the anterior direction of the SEBTm (p=0.001; ES=2.2). In the active repositioning test, no significant changes were observed in the control group, while the experimental group improved up to 82.8% in the hip joint (p=0.001; ES=2.72).

Combining the current development hotspots of mobile smart terminals and smart wearable devices, smart wearable devices are analyzed from the function and development history in order to find an effective combination of smart wearable devices and sports work. This article describes the youth as the main body receiving grassroots physical education of nonsports special students and basketball enthusiasts. In the process of physical education teaching, the problem of pain points is more prominent because most teenagers in the basketball education at the grass-roots level do not have the opportunity to get one-to-one private counseling. When there are problems in the operation, students cannot be guided to conduct training or practice by themselves. This paper aims to meet the demand of real-time monitoring of dribbling posture in basketball dribbling training and proposes a low-cost product solution to help teenagers carry out basketball dribbling training by themselves: Intelligent wearable product of head wrist and dribbling assistant DribbleAid, which is used to monitor common bad posture problems of users in dribbling training and give corresponding reminders to deal with users' pain points. In this work, various experiments have been carried out for the proposed method and system.

Objective: To explore the characteristics of basketball players’ cardiac response to increasing load training. Methods: By analyzing 12 juvenile male amateur basketball training athletes, when performing incremental load exercises on the treadmill, using a 12-lead electrocardiograph to record the electrocardiogram, HR, and blood pressure responses for each level of exercise. Results: The mean heart rate of the basketball players before movement was 82.45 ± 11.44bpm, slightly higher than the heart rate at rest. Depending on the exercise load, the blood pressure should increase by 5 to 12 mmHg. Under different load training conditions, each level of blood pressure in the Bruce treadmill test procedure should increase 12.5 ~ 44mmHg. The basketball player’s systolic pressure increased by 2.25 ~ 15.7mmHg, diastolic pressure increased by 0.43 to 11.37 mmHg. Conclusions: In basketball players, the psychological stress is less than that of the average person performing the same exercise.

Two high-definition cameras were used to simultaneously capture kinematic parameters of shooting motions. The type of shooting approach showed as a non-influential factor. During the preparatory phase of the shooting motion, PRO 2-point shooters demonstrated higher elbow and basketball height placements, greater flexion in the shoulder and elbow joints while attaining greater release and entry ball angles during the release phase. PRO 3-point shooters demonstrated greater elbow flexion, higher basketball placement, and less hip flexion during the preparatory phase while attaining greater heel, release, and trajectory heights during the release phase.

The results showed some significant differences, although with magnitudes qualified as small. When the teams won, the guards covered a greater distance at 0-6 km/h than when they lost. When teams lost, the centers covered more distance at 12-18 km/h and 18-21 km/h. The winning female teams presented a lower maximal heart rate (HRmax) compared to the losing teams. The forwards of the winning teams performed greater efforts at 70-80% HRmax, while the forwards of losing teams performed more efforts at 90-95% HRmax. The greatest number of accelerations and decelerations were performed by the female guards and the male forwards. The number of jumps was higher in the male guards and forwards than in the female ones. HRmax was higher in the forwards of the female teams. Efforts at 80%-90% HRmax were higher in male centers. When the female teams won, they had a lower HRmax than when they lost. When efforts exceed 90% of HRmax the teams lost. In conclusion, despite the differences found, the effect of these contextual variables on physical and physiological demands is unclear. Nevertheless, knowing the game’s requirements can help the design of training that enhances the performance of youth basketball players. © 2022 Revista Internacional de Ciencias del Deporte.

Teenagers 'love' for basketball further promotes the improvement of basketball level in China. However, the reality of basketball in China still lags far behind that of developed basketball countries, in which backward training is an important aspect. This paper mainly makes a comprehensive overview of the training effect and classification of basketball players through particle swarm optimization, objectively evaluates the training effect of physical fitness, and proposes corresponding optimization measures, aiming at the scientific optimization of physical training for basketball players in China. In order to rationally arrange the training methods, control the training process, and make the training scientific, the effectiveness of the particle swarm optimization algorithm for the classification of basketball players' training effects is analyzed, and a new population-based optimization method is proposed. The experimental results verify the superiority of the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

Albeit not usually perceived as being at high risk for tetanus, the Italian legal framework (Law No. 292 of 1963; Presidential Decree 1301/1965) requires tetanus vaccination (TeV) even for amateur practice. Even though some previous reports have suggested a relatively low adherence towards vaccination practice among basketball player, corresponding knowledge, attitudes and practices towards TeV remain largely unknown. Our study specifically investigated such topics in a total of 270 amateur basketball players participating into an internet-based survey by completing a structured questionnaire. Of them, 73.0% had a proper vaccination status, but a third of respondents (33.3%) exhibited some degree of vaccine hesitancy. The average understanding of TeV and tetanus (79.8% with a potential range 0–100) as well as the risk perception for natural infection (63.9% ± 26.6) were quite good. Even though unmotivated fears towards TeV were more scarcely reported (14.0% ± 15.4), they still represented the main reasons for having missed vaccination shots (63.0%). Knowledge status and risk perception for natural infection and TeV were well correlated (R = 0.22 and R = −0.64, respectively). Appropriate TeV status was more likely in respondents not exhibiting vaccine hesitancy (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.114, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) 0.059–0.225). In turn, vaccine hesitancy was more frequently reported among individuals of male gender (OR 3.148, 95%CI 1.072–9.244), while better formal education (OR 0.065, 95%CI 0.013–0.319) and working in healthcare settings (OR 0.042, 95%CI 0.007–0.265) were characterized as negative effectors. Vaccinations in athletes represent an often overlooked issue, with a considerable lack of available evidence. The results stress the opportunity for appropriate TeV screening programs among amateur athletes and the potential relevance of interventions aimed at raising the perceived significance of TeV in order to cope with a significant share of vaccine-hesitant athletes. © 2022 by the authors.

However, there is a considerable degree if interindividual variability concerning these social outcomes and thus not all preschool children with ASD profit from a MBTP intervention to the same extent. In order to make more accurate predictions which preschool children with ASD can benefit from an MBTP intervention or which preschool children with ASD need additional interventions to achieve behavioral improvements, further research is required. This study aimed to investigate which individual factors of preschool children with ASD can predict MBTP intervention outcomes concerning SC impairments and RRBs. Then, test the performance of machine learning models in predicting intervention outcomes based on these factors. Participants were 26 preschool children with ASD who enrolled in a quasi-experiment and received MBTP intervention. Baseline demographic variables (e.g., age, body, mass index [BMI]), indicators of physical fitness (e.g., handgrip strength, balance performance), performance in executive function, severity of ASD symptoms, level of SC impairments, and severity of RRBs were obtained to predict treatment outcomes after MBTP intervention. Machine learning models were established based on support vector machine algorithm were implemented. For comparison, we also employed multiple linear regression models in statistics. Our findings suggest that in preschool children with ASD symptomatic severity (r = 0.712, p &lt; 0.001) and baseline SC impairments (r = 0.713, p &lt; 0.001) are predictors for intervention outcomes of SC impair-ments. Furthermore, BMI (r = −0.430, p = 0.028), symptomatic severity (r = 0.656, p &lt; 0.001), baseline SC impairments (r = 0.504, p = 0.009) and baseline RRBs (r = 0.647, p &lt; 0.001) can predict intervention outcomes of RRBs. Statistical models predicted 59.6% of variance in post-treatment SC impairments (MSE = 0.455, RMSE = 0.675, R2 = 0.596) and 58.9% of variance in post-treatment RRBs (MSE = 0.464, RMSE = 0.681, R2 = 0.589). Machine learning models predicted 83% of variance in post-treatment SC impairments (MSE = 0.188, RMSE = 0.434, R2 = 0.83) and 85.9% of variance in post-treatment RRBs (MSE = 0.051, RMSE = 0.226, R2 = 0.859), which were better than statistical models. Our findings suggest that baseline characteristics such as symptomatic severity of ASD symptoms and SC impairments are important predictors determining MBTP intervention-induced improvements concerning SC impairments and RBBs. Furthermore, the current study revealed that machine learning models can successfully be applied to predict the MBTP intervention-related outcomes in preschool children with ASD, and performed better than statistical models. Our findings can help to inform which preschool children with ASD are most likely to benefit from an MBTP intervention, and they might provide a reference for the development of personalized intervention programs for preschool children with ASD. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

The team's winning rate is not the only factor to be considered to determine the strength of the team. There are many factors to be considered for determining the strength of the team. According to the variation coefficient of basketball scoring frequency, the paper designs the principal model of basketball players' pitching target system. The data is captured by IoT devices and smart devices. The algorithm sets the number of the frequency of Gabor filter transformation features, controls the error accumulation, extracts the cascade features of basketball score video, constructs the video conversion discrimination rules, detects the basketball target, and obtains the tracking target contour to frame information. Finally, it realizes the target tracking detection of the team based on the team strength using an evaluation algorithm. The aim of this research work is to determine the strength of the team based on the healthcare data, team cohesiveness, and variance coefficient of basketball score frequency. The study on the coefficient of variation for basketball score frequency in teams can provide a theoretical research direction for team strength evaluation and meet the real-time needs of the coefficient of variation of basketball score frequency in teams. The empirical results show that the designed algorithm has the optimal execution time, more successful evaluation targets, high efficiency, and more reliability in evaluating the strength of the team. © 2022 Jian Qiao.",,"Gabor filters; Health care; Target tracking; Coefficients of variations; Error accumulation; Evaluation algorithm; Real- time; Smart devices; Strength evaluation; Target systems; Targets tracking; Theoretical research; Variation coefficient; Internet of things; abduction; Article; basketball; basketball player; femoral condyle; femoral head; femoral neck; femoral shaft; femur; friction; gluteus muscle; health data; human; kernel method; mental health; muscle strength; mutation rate; reference value; videorecording; algorithm; athletic performance; health care delivery; reproducibility; Algorithms; Athletic Performance; Basketball; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123052029

In addition, their predictive value of physical characteristics was determined for the evaluation of players’ physical preparedness. Sixty elite male basketball players performed 13 standardized specific field tests in order to assess the explosive power of lower limbs, speed, and change-of-direction speed. They were divided into three groups according to playing positions (guard [n = 28], forward [n = 22], center [n = 10]). The basic characteristics of the tested sample were: age = 17.36 ± 1.04 years, body height = 192.80 ± 4.49 cm, body mass = 79.83 ± 6.94 kg, and basketball experience = 9.38 ± 2.10 years for guards; age = 18.00 ± 1.00 years, body height = 201.48 ± 3.14 cm, body mass = 90.93 ± 9.85 kg, and basketball experience = 9.93 ± 2.28 years for forwards; and age = 17.60 ± 1.43 years; body height = 207.20 ± 3.29 cm, body mass = 104.00 ± 9.64 kg, and basketball experience = 9.20 ± 1.62 years for centers. For all playing positions factor analysis extracted three factors, which cumulatively explained 76.87, 88.12 and 87.63% of variance, respectively. The assessed performance measures were defined as significant (p &lt; 0.001), with regression models of physical performance index (PPINDEX ). PPINDEX of guards = −6.860 + (0.932 × t-test) − (1.656 × Acceleration 15 m) − (0.020 × Countermovement jump); PPINDEX of forwards = −3.436 − (0.046 × Countermovement jump with arm swing) − (1.295 × Acceleration 15 m) + (0.582 × Control of dribbling); PPINDEX of centers = −4.126 + (0.604 × Control of dribbling) − (1.315 × Acceleration 15 m) − (0.037 × Sargent jump). A model for the evaluation of physical performance of young basketball players has been defined. In addition, this model could be used as a reference model for selection procedures, as well as to monitor the efficacy of applied training programmes within the short, medium and long-term periodization. © 2022 by the authors.

For this reason, functional tests are used for injury assessment and prevention, analyzing physical or physiological imbalances and detecting asymmetries. The main aim of this study was to detect the asymmetries in the upper limbs (right and left arms) in athletes, using the OctoBalance Test (OB), depending on the stage of the season. Two hundred and fifty-two participants (age: 23.33 ± 8.96 years old; height: 178.63 ± 11.12 cm; body mass: 80.28 ± 17.61 kg; body mass index: 24.88 ± 4.58; sports experience: 12.52 ± 6.28 years), practicing different sports (rugby, athletics, football, swimming, handball, triathlon, basketball, hockey, badminton and volleyball), assessed with the OB in medial, superolateral, and inferolateral directions in both arms, in four moments of the season (May 2017, September 2017, February 2018 and May 2018). ANOVA test was used with repeated measures with a p ≤ 0.05, for the analysis of the different studied variances. Significant differences were found (p = 0.021) in the medial direction of the left arm, between the first (May 2017) and fourth stages (May 2018), with values of 71.02 ± 7.15 cm and 65.03 ± 7.66 cm. From the detection of asymmetries, using the OB to measure, in the medial, superolateral and inferolateral directions, mobility and balance can be assessed. In addition, it is possible to observe functional imbalances, as a risk factor for injury, in each of the stages into which the season is divided, which will help in the prevention of injuries and in the individualization of training. © 2022 by the authors.

Subjects were asked to perform basketball jump shot task during a four-step process. In total, participants shot 150 shots (10 shots in the pretest, 120 shots and 40 observations in the practice phase, and 10 shots in the posttest and the retention test). Accuracy scores and cognitive status were assessed as dependent variables. Results: Results showed that observation of real, animated and combined model demonstrations had significant effects on motor and cognitive learning of a basketball jump shot. Moreover, there was no significant difference between observing animated model and real model demonstrations at motor level, however, animated model demonstration group performed better than real model group at cognitive level. Finally, combined model demonstration group performed better than both animated and real model demonstrations groups. Conclusions: Results suggested that observing animated model demonstration is an appropriate approach for learning basketball jump shot even in children. It is also recommended to use animated model demonstration as a complement to real model. © 2022 Akbar Ghavami et al., published by Sciendo.","Cognitive learning; Model demonstration; Motor learning; Observation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122108101

This is especially worrying in U18 categories. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify the influence that the coach’s anger has on the performance of a basketball team in competition. For this, an ad hoc observation tool was designed, in which 587 moments of anger from the coaching staff (64 coaches) were recorded in the 24 semi-final and final matches of the Spanish Autonomous Region Team Championships in 2019 and 2020 in the infantil (M = 14 years old) and cadete (M = 16 years old) categories. The results show that, in response to most incidents of coach anger, the performance of the team did not change. Significant differences were identified in some scenarios, with low-or medium-intensity anger targeted at the defence, where the team performance improved. However, anger towards the referee in the last quarter with scores level had a negative influence on the team’s performance. © 2022 by the authors.

It is yet little known about how trait personality dimensions associate with risk events and how vital factors, such as risk perception, could affect the happening of risk events in adolescent athletes. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the prediction of risk events by regression analysis with dimensions of personality, risk perception and sports, relations between risk events, risk perception, and the facets of the personality dimensions via data collecting from 664 adolescent athletes aged 13–18 years (male 364, female 300). Secondary intent is to assess school-specific levels of training risks among sports schools, regular schools, and sports and education integrated schools. The results show that psychology events are the strongest predicted by personality traits, risk perception, and sports, followed by injury and nutrition. Emotionality has the most significant positive correlation with risk events, while other traits have a significant negative correlation with risk events, except agreeableness. The integration schools are more conducive to the healthy development of adolescent athletes’ personalities. Moreover, the research indicates that sports training can strengthen the development directions of different personality characteristics. © 2021 by the authors.

Although this phenomenon is well known in a male context, limited data are available in female sports. Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify the prevalence and magnitude of the RAE in a female Italian context at the professional level in basketball, soccer, and volleyball. A total of 1535 birthdates of elite senior players were analyzed overall and separately between early and late career stages. Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests were applied to investigate the RAE in each sport. An asymmetry in birthdates was observed in all sports (Crammer’s V ranged = 0.10–0.12). Players born close to the beginning of the year were 1.62 and 1.61 times more likely to reach first and second Italian divisions of soccer and volleyball, respectively, than those born in the last part of the year. A small over-representation of female athletes born close to the beginning of the year is evident at the senior professional level in all Italian investigated team sports. In soccer, this trend was more evident in the first stage of a senior career. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study looks into the evolution of the training load using the RPE and s-RPE method and describes the injuries observed. It is an observational study based on 9 subjects of the Pardinyes basketball team (Leb Plata category) who, in each practice and match, recorded their RPE. This value, together with the volume (in minutes), provides the s-RPE. All injuries and their typology were also recorded during the first round of the competition. A total of 124 sessions were registered and 14 injuries were described in the period that went from 09/19/2019 to 02/15/2020. The load evolution of each player has been compared to the team average and to the one perceived by the coach. The lower extremity was, by far, the most injured one (13/14 injury events). The highest percentage of injuries was registered during the last part of the training sessions and matches, coinciding with the highest physical and psychological fatigue, and 64% of them were due to microtrauma.

Although female sex is considered a risk factor, it is still unknown whether female and male team-sport players, in fact, differ in their injury rates. We aimed to compare injury rates between female and male players by systematically reviewing and meta-analyzing injury surveillance studies of both sexes in order to evaluate sex-specific differences in team-sport injuries. Methods: Studies that prospectively collected injury data for high-level female and male players (age ≥16 years) in basketball, field hockey, football (soccer), handball, rugby (union and sevens), and volleyball were included. Two reviewers (AZ and ALR) independently assessed study quality and extracted data for overall, match, training, and severe injuries (>28 days’ time loss) as well as data regarding injury locations and types. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were pooled in a meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis was performed when 10 or more studies were available. Results: Of 20 studies, 9 studies reported injury data from football, 3 studies from rugby, 3 studies from handball, 1 study from basketball, 1 study from field hockey, 2 studies from volleyball, and 1 study from basketball and field hockey. For overall injuries, the pooled IRR = 0.86 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.76−0.98) indicated significantly more injuries in male than in female players. For injury location, the pooled IRR showed higher injury rates in male athletes than in female athletes for upper extremity, hip/groin, thigh, and foot injuries. Female players had a significantly higher rate of anterior cruciate ligament injuries (IRR = 2.15, 95%CI: 1.27−3.62) than male players. No significant sex-specific differences in IRR were found for match, training, severe injuries, concussions, or ankle sprains. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis provides evidence for sex-specific differences in the injury rates in team sports. Further epidemiological studies including both sexes in sports other than football are needed in order to strengthen the evidence. © 2021","Athletes; Female; Injuries; Male; Team sports","achilles tendon rupture; adolescent; adult; ankle injury; ankle sprain; anterior cruciate ligament injury; athlete; basketball; competition; concussion; controlled study; female; foot injury; football player; hockey; human; incidence; injury; injury severity; male; meta analysis; practice guideline; prospective study; Review; rugby; sex difference; sport injury; sprain; systematic review; team sport; volleyball; football; regression analysis; sexual characteristics; sport injury; Adolescent; Athletic Injuries; Female; Football; Humans; Male; Regression Analysis; Sex Characteristics; Team Sports",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117293080

Single-leg landing is frequent in basketball and volleyball, two sports with high incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injuries. The similarity in the number of landings between these sports could be the culprit of the high incidence of injuries. However, the comparison of knee joint motion during landings in both sports has yet to be investigated. This study aimed to contrast the knee kinematics of basketball and volleyball athletes during a single-leg landing task. Methods. Overall, 10 male athletes, 5 in basketball (181.4 ± 6.7 cm; 93.21 ± 33.06 kg) and 5 in volleyball (178.4 ± 6.6 cm, 79.11 ± 6.46 kg) performed single-leg drop landings. Differences between the groups were verified with the superposition of 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, the probability approach was applied with magnitude-based inferential statistics calculated to compare individual instants (40 ms after the initial ground contact, maximum flexion, and abduction). Results. Different knee movement patterns were detected between the groups. While volleyball athletes showed greater knee flexion, basketball players exhibited greater knee abduction. The magnitude-based inference also demonstrated that volleyball athletes presented higher values in the sagittal plane. Conclusions. Basketball athletes exhibited greater valgus in the instants before and after ground contact. In addition, volleyball athletes showed greater knee flexion during the single-leg drop landing. © University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Joint angle; Knee; Single-leg landing","abduction; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; basketball player; controlled study; human; inferential statistics; joint function; kinematics; knee function; male; probability; volleyball",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115920070

Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) capture these biomechanical loads as PlayerLoad and Inertial Movement Analysis (IMA) and teams collect those data to monitor adaptations to training schedules. However, the association of biomechanical loads with game performance is a relatively unexplored area. The aims of the current study were to determine the statistical relations between biomechanical loads in games and training with game performance. Biomechanical training and game load measures and player-level and team-level game stats from one college basketball team of two seasons were included in the dataset. The training loads were obtained on the days before gameday. A three-step analysis pipeline modeled: (i) relations between team-level game stats and the win/loss probabilities of the team, (ii) associations between the player-level training and game loads and their game stats, and (iii) associations between player-level training loads and game loads. The results showed that offensive and defensive game stats increased the odds of winning, but several stats were subject to positional and individual performance variability. Further analyses, therefore, included total points [PTS], two-point field goals, and defensive rebounds (DEF REB) that were less subject to those influences. Increases in game loads were significantly associated with game stats. In addition, training loads significantly affected the game loads in the following game. In particular, increased loads 2 days before the game resulted in increased expected game loads. Those findings suggested that biomechanical loads were good predictors for game performance. Specifically, the game loads were good predictors for game stats, and training loads 2 days before gameday were good predictors for the expected game load. The current analyses accounted for the variation in loads of players and stats that enabled modeling the expected game performance for each individual. Coaches, trainers, and sports scientists can use these findings to further optimize training plans and possibly make in-game decisions for individual player performance.

There is a lack of studies investigating the effect of fatigue on kinematics and kinetics in basketball dribbling. There are two primary aims of this study: (1) to explore the effect of fatigue on kinematics and kinetics in dribbling with the change of directions; (2) to determine the effect of fatigue on dribbling speed. Fourteen Croatian senior male basketball players, not power forwards or centers (age: 21.16±3.43 years; body height: 188.81±6.88 cm; body mass: 87.81±6.06 kg; body fat: 13.34±3.52%) participated in the study. Each player performed two types of change of direction (COD) while dribbling: front COD and spin move in the non-fatigued and then in the fatigued state. Xsens suit and Novel insoles were used to measure the kinematic and kinetic parameters. In terms of the front COD, the results of this study demonstrated that the maximum angular velocity in the knee (p=.028) and wrist joint (p=.007) as well as maximum force (p=.004) significantly decreased in the fatigued state. In terms of the spin move, the results showed that there were significant differences in pelvis velocity (p=.000), the maximum angular velocity in the knee joint (p=.020), and the first step velocity (p=0.010) between the fatigued and non-fatigued states. No significant difference was found in the pelvis position, minimum angle in the knee joint and maximum force. Importantly, dribbling speed significantly decreased in the fatigued state (p=.002). The findings of this study suggest that coaching staff should design appropriate training programs to optimize players’ ability to resist fatigue when dribbling under real game speed conditions. © 2021, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Kinesiology.

These transitions are not always completely successful and could highly impact the route of the players' development. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the psychological processes involved when players encounter problems in adapting from one club to another. Thus, it was the aim of this study to identify the most difficult aspects of these transitions, as experienced by team sports players and the psychological skills that contribute to successful outcomes. Design and Method: The present study included twenty professional basketball players (aged between 20 and 36 years old; Mean = 26.05, SD = 4.12), who had played under different coaches (coach range 4–15; Mean = 8.65, SD = 2.92), and also played for different clubs (range 3–10; Mean = 5.35, SD = 2.08). They took part in retrospective interviews regarding their embedded experiences during club to club transitions. A situated E-approach was used to identify their problematic experiences, the adaptability skills and how they are applied during club mutations. Results and Conclusions: The identification of problematic experiences revealed seven components in relation to coaching (e.g., obeying orders, reduced play time), three components with teammates (e.g., respect), two components with the club (e.g., lack of support), and three components with family/friends (e.g., geographical constraints). Additionally, results indicated that the adaptability skills used during mutation are related to three groups namely mental skills, learning methods, and interpersonal skills. The results provide coaches, players, sports psychologists, and national sport organizations a set of issues for understanding the challenges players encounter when they move from one club to another.

Specifically, screens are one of the offensive tactical elements most used in basketball and one example of a tactical situation that needs the highest preparation level to get a good performance in the competition. The aim of this study is to differentiate these player behaviors by gender using data mining and polar coordinates analysis. Therefore, one ad hoc observational tool made by 17 criteria and 97 exhaustive and mutually exclusive (E/ME) categories has been designed and validated using the data quality analysis (correlation coefficients and concordance index 0.98) and generalizability analysis (G coefficients 0.94) to perform such a study. The observational design is nomothetic, punctual, and multidimensional. A total of 176 ball screens situations have been analyzed for the men's category and 118 for women's category, corresponding to three different teams of each gender playing in the highest competition level in Spain during the 2018/2019 season using Hoisan software tool. The analysis of the relationships among behaviors has been performed using Polar Coordinates analysis as well as data mining analysis: clustering and decision tree classifier.

Cycling predominantly involves concentric activity of the gastrocnemius muscles, while playing basketball requires both concentric and eccentric actions to support running, jumping, and landing. The aim of this study was to examine differences in the architecture of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) between elite basketballers and cyclists. A trained sonographer obtained three B-mode ultrasound images from GM and GL muscles in 44 athletes (25 basketballers and 19 cyclists; 24 ± 5 years of age). The images were digitized and average fascicle length (FL), pennation angle (θ), and muscle thickness were calculated from three images per muscle. The ratio of FL to tibial length (FL/TL) and muscle thickness to tibial length (MT/TL) was also calculated to account for the potential scaling effect of stature. In males, no significant differences were identified between the athletic groups in all parameters in the GM, but a significant difference existed in muscle thickness in the GL. In basketballers, GL was 2.5 mm thicker (95% CI: 0.7–4.3 mm, p = 0.011) on the left side and 2.6 mm thicker (95% CI: 0.6–5.7 mm, p = 0.012) on the right side; however, these differences were not significant when stature was accounted for (MT/TL). In females, significant differences existed in the GM for all parameters including FL/TL and MT/TL. Female cyclists had longer FL in both limbs (MD: 11.2 and 11.3 mm), narrower θ (MD: 2.1 and 1.8°), and thicker muscles (MD: 2.1 and 2.5 mm). For the GL, female cyclists had significantly longer FL (MD: 5.2 and 5.8 mm) and narrower θ (MD: 1.7 and 2.3°) in both limbs; no differences were observed in absolute muscle thickness or MT/TL ratio. Differences in gastrocnemius muscle architecture were observed between female cyclists and basketballers, but not between males. These findings suggest that participation in sport-specific training might influence gastrocnemius muscle architecture in elite female athletes; however, it remains unclear as to whether gastrocnemius architecture is systematically influenced by the different modes of muscle activation between these respective sports.

We conducted a qualitative study, including 17 semistructured interviews. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed by two independent coders through constant comparative data analysis based on Grounded Theory principles. Our findings overview the athlete's journey to becoming an elite athlete, and how an elite sports context influences and modulates injury prevention practice at this level. Participants described an elite athletic career as a continuous and adaptive evolving process. According to athletes and all stakeholders, sports injury prevention is a learning process shaped by individual experiences. This embodiment provides athletes with insight into the importance of ownership of their bodies and self-awareness. Thus, experience, communication, empowerment, knowledge, education, the elite athlete context and sports culture, all play a fundamental role in sports injury prevention. Our findings support the importance of contextual factors in sports injury prevention in an elite sports context. These results also bring practical implications on how we should approach injury prevention differently along an athlete's journey to becoming an elite athlete. Considering specific contextual factors and influencing the process through awareness, communication and a shared responsibility is essential to develop a healthy and successful athlete. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Material and methods: The research included a sample of 39 professional athletes. The first subsample included 19 professional basketball players while the second subsample included 20 professional soccer players. Results: Based on the results of the torques of the extensors in the knee joint of the DOM and ND legs, it was established that there is no statistically significant difference between basketball players and football players. However, a statistically significant difference was found in the torque flexors of the knee joint DOM (p≤0.01) and ND (p≤0.00) of the leg between basketball players and football players. On the other hand, the results of the research indicate that the difference between basketball players and football players in the ratio of Hamstrings peak torque to Quadriceps peak torque was recorded only in the ND leg (p≤0.02), while the difference in the DOM leg is not statistically significant. The results of our study indicate that basketball players have a higher percentage of imbalances compared to football players, especially in m. hamstrings.

However, it is unknown whether female recreational athletes are susceptible to fatigue or not, compared to female collegiate athletes with greater physical activity. The purpose of the present study was to examine and clarify the effects of fatigue and recovery on knee biomechanics of the drop vertical jump (DVJ) in female recreational athletes compared to female collegiate athletes. Methods: Fifteen female collegiate athletes and ten female recreational athletes were enrolled in the current study. All subjects were basketball players and Tegner activity scales were level 9 and 7, respectively. They performed DVJ before and after the fatigue protocol. Three-dimensional knee kinematics and kinetics were collected during landing phase of DVJ. The data after the fatigue protocol (first, second, and third DVJs) were compared with those before the protocol using one-way repeated measures of analysis of variance in each group. Results: Fatigue caused significant increase of knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC) and peak abduction moments within 40 ms from IC in female recreational athletes, whereas no increases of these parameters were observed in female collegiate athletes. Moreover, recovery from fatigue seemed to be more slowly in female recreational athletes than in female collegiate athletes as smaller knee flexion moment was observed even in post-fatigue third DVJ only for female recreational athletes. Conclusions: Effects of fatigue on DVJ were significantly greater and continued for a longer duration in female recreational athletes compared to female collegiate athletes. © 2021, The Author(s).","Activity level; Knee abduction moment; Landing task; Motion capture system; Three-dimensional assessment","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; athlete; biomechanics; fatigue; female; human; knee; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Athletes; Biomechanical Phenomena; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Knee; Knee Joint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122073812

The less-publicised story was that in 2017, SI predicted the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the Major League Baseball (MLB) title. Assessing the forecasting accuracy of experts is critical as it explores the difficulty and limitations of forecasts and can help illuminate how predictions may shape sociocultural notions of sport in society. To thoroughly investigate SI’s forecasting record, predictions were collected from the four major North American sporting leagues (the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and National Hockey League) over the last 30 years (1988–2018). Kruskal–Wallis H Tests and Mann–Whitney U Tests were used to evaluate the absolute and relative accuracy of predictions. Results indicated that SI had the greatest predictive accuracy in the National Basketball Association and was significantly more likely to predict divisional winners compared to conference and league champions.

This study describes the epidemiology of hand and wrist injuries among collegiate athletes competing in different divisions. Methods: The National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP) was accessed from 2004 to 2015 for the following sports: baseball, basketball, football, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, wrestling, field hockey, gymnastics, softball and volleyball. The data were used to identify all hand and wrist injuries, the specific injury diagnosis, mean time loss of activity following injury, and need for surgery following injury. These were then stratified by gender. Descriptive statistics were performed to examine the association between sports, event type and division. Student's t test was used to calculate p-values for independent variables. Chi-Square test was used to calculate odds ratio. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: 103,098 hand and wrist injuries were reported in in the studied NCAA sports from 2004 to 2015. Male athletes sustained 72,423 injuries (6.01/10,000 athlete exposure) and female athletes sustained 30,675 injuries (4.13/10,000 athlete exposure). Division I athletes sustained significantly more injuries compared to divisions II and III. Overall, 3.78% of hand and wrist injuries required surgical intervention. A significantly higher percentage of division I athletes (both male and female) underwent surgical intervention compared to divisions II and III. The mean time lost due to hand and wrist injury was 7.14 days for all athletes. Division I athletes missed the fewest days due to injury at 6.29 days though this was not significant. Conclusions: Hand and wrist injuries are common among collegiate athletes. Division I athletes sustain higher rates of injuries and higher surgical intervention rates, while tending to miss fewer days due to injury. Improved characterization of divisional differences in hand and wrist injuries can assist injury management and prevention. © 2021, The Author(s).","College; Division I; Division II; Division III; Hand injuries; Injury rates; NCAA; Wrist injuries","Article; baseball; basketball; cross-sectional study; dislocation; female; football; gymnastics; hand injury; hockey; human; ice hockey; lacrosse (sport); major clinical study; male; metacarpal bone fracture; phalanx fracture; retrospective study; scaphoid fracture; soccer; softball; student athlete; volleyball; wrestling; wrist fracture; wrist injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121312521

However, few studies investigate the changes in physiological and mental profiles during varied sport periodization among this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the changes in sports performance and stress-related biomarkers between the competitive season (CS) and off-season (OS) in elite adolescent basketball players. Method: Nine elite Division I male basketball players (age: 15–18 years. old) participated in this study. Basketball-specific performance, salivary dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)/cortisol levels, mood state, and sleep quality were all accessed during the CS and OS periods. Results: The training load during OS was 26.0% lower than CS (p = 0.001). Muscle mass, aerobic capacity, 10 m sprint, and Abalakov jump (AJ) power during OS were greater than that during CS (+2.2–9.8%, p < 0.05), but planned agility was greater during CS (p = 0.003). The salivary DHEA-S/cortisol was greater during CS than during OS (p = 0.039). The overall mood state and sleep quality did not differ between periods, but the POMS-tension was higher during CS (p = 0.005). Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that muscle mass, aerobic capacity, peak AJ power, and 10 m sprint performance, but not planned agility, were greater during OS compared to CS among elite adolescent basketball players. Furthermore, the stress-related responses reflected by the D/C ratio and mood tension were relatively lower during the OS in these athletes. Thus, this study suggests that coaches and sport science professionals should closely monitor athletes’ training states across varied training/competition periods to better react to modifying training or recovery plans. © 2021 by the authors.

Nine female basketball players completed 4 weeks of repeated sprint training (RST) with (COD, n = 4) or without (NCOD, n = 5) changes of direction. A battery of sprints (0–10 and 0–25 m), vertical jumps (counter movement jump (CMJ), drop jump, and single-leg CMJs), and COD tests were conducted before and after intervention. NCOD completed two sets of ten sprints of 20 m, whereas COD performed 20 m sprints with a 180 degree turn at 10 m, returning to the starting line. Before each sprint, participants were instructed to provide different fluctuations (i.e., differential learning) in terms of varying the sprint. Both groups had 30 s of passive recovery between two sprints and 3 min between sets. A significant effect of time for the 0–10 m sprint, CMJ, and single leg-CMJ asymmetries were observed. Adding “erroneous” fluctuation during RST seems to be a suitable and feasible strategy for coaches to enhance physical performance in young female basketball players. However, further studies including larger samples and controlled designs are recommended to strengthen present findings. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, our objective was to verify the effectiveness of two types of physical activities through sports, judo and ball games (soccer, volleyball, handball, and basketball) on the quality of sleep and life of Brazilian children and adolescents. Methods: The study is a randomized clinical trial, conducted with 65 participants of both sexes (6–15 years old) in a philanthropic institution in Brazil. The variables investigated were the quality of sleep and life, using the mini-sleep questionnaire and KidsCreen-52 questionnaires (this instrument has a scale ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 is the best value for each domain), respectively. The interventions carried out during 12 weeks (twice a week) were judo and ball games. In the statistical analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures was used and the level of statistical significance used was 5%. Results: Judo (P = 0.032) and ball games (P = 0.005) contributed to improving the quality of sleep in the participants. Considering the score of the domains of quality of life, judo and ball games significantly increased the perception of health and physical activity [mean = 6.9 (8.3%) and 8.91 (12.2%) points, respectively], autonomy [mean = 5.81 (7.3%) and 5.00 (6.9%) points], friends and social support (mean = 2.83 (3.8%) and 12.00 (15.9%) points), provocation and bullying [mean = 10.21 (18.1%) and 2.14 (4.1%) points]. Conclusion: It is concluded that both judo and ball games brought benefits to the quality of sleep and life of children and adolescents. Health promotion actions should encourage the increase in sports practice in children and adolescents to improve sleep and quality of life. © 2021, The Author(s).","Children and adolescents; Motor behavior; Physical activity; Quality of life; Sleep quality; Sport","adolescent; analysis of variance; article; basketball; Brazil; Brazilian; bullying; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; friend; health promotion; human; human experiment; judo; locomotion; major clinical study; male; perception; physical activity; provocation; quality of life; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; sleep quality; soccer; social support; statistical significance; volleyball",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119095799

Although effective preventive strategies in scientific literature exist, their implementation is lagging behind. The Internet could support the translation of knowledge from the literature to end-users, but the quality of the online resources would have to be assured. This online-based systematic review is to assess availability, readability, quality, and content of the websites presenting exercise-based sports injury risk reduction (prevention) programmes. Moreover, the quality of reporting and contents of the exercise programmes were assessed. Methods: Google, Yahoo, and Bing were searched on 2 September 2018. We used ‘sports injury prevention program*’ and ‘sports injury prevention warm-up’ as search phrases. The owners/authors of the included websites were asked for further recommendations on online resources. Search updates were run in DuckDuckGo on 15 May 2020 and 22 August 2021. Eligible websites were active, in English, and contained instructions for the exercise/s aiming at sports injury prevention. Two reviewers independently screened the links and previews and performed an in-depth appraisal of included websites. The website quality was assessed using JAMA framework criteria and Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) certification. The readability of websites was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease score. The reporting appraisal of exercise programmes was done using the modified Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT). Results: Among 480 websites screened, 16 were eligible with an additional four recommended and nine found in search updates (29 in total). None of the websites was certified by HONcode. The overall quality of websites was low 2.1 ± 1.0/4, but overall readability was high 67 ± 17/100. The average quality of reporting of exercise programmes was low 5.79 ± 3.1/12. Websites with community input had the lowest readability, but the highest quality, and vice versa websites run by businesses had the highest readability, but the lowest quality. Eight websites presented programmes tested for effectiveness. Conclusions: Overall, the quality of the websites was low, but their readability was high. Improvements required are relatively easy to implement (i.e. including the date when the website was updated, applying for HONcode certification) and extremely important (e.g. providing resources on which the website’s content is based). There are some sports injury risk reduction programmes reported with high quality and effectiveness-tested available online for team sports, but none for individual sports.

Literature however reports various body positions and upper limb pushing patterns to perform USSPT, demanding to provide additional guideline to achieve overweight ball push. This study therefore aimed at assessing the reliability and agreement of USSPT outcome measures when pushing an overweight ball in a horizontal direction. Methods: Twenty-seven healthy male athletes performed two sessions, one week apart, of three unilateral pushes per upper limb using a 3-kg medicine ball, for which the distances were measured. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), minimum detectable change at a 95 % confidence level (MDC95 %) and coefficient of variation (CV) were assessed for the pushing distances based on one, two or three trials per side to produce two outcome measures: the pushing distance per limb and USSPT Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) when dividing pushing distance of the dominant side by that of the non-dominant side. Results: The most reliable pushing distance per limb was obtained when averaging three pushing distances, normalized by body mass with the exponent 0.35. The mean USSPT LSI was 1.09 ± 0.10 for the first session and 1.08 ± 0.10 for the second session, highlighting good reliability and agreement (ICC = 0.82; SEM = 0.045; MDC95 % = 0.124; CV = 5.02 %). Conclusions: When the overweight ball is pushed in a horizontal direction, averaging the distances of three trials for both the dominant and non-dominant limbs is advised to provide the most reliable USSPT distance per limb and USSPT LSI. © 2021, The Author(s).","Limb symmetry index; Minimum detectable change; Physical performance test; Standard error of measurement; Upper limb power","adult; Article; athlete; basketball; body mass; climbing; clinical outcome; controlled study; correlation coefficient; decision making; functional status assessment; human; knee function; male; middle finger; minimum detectable change; muscle strength; normal human; physical performance; resistance training; return to sport; running; shoulder; sitting; soccer; unilateral seated shot put test; upper limb; volleyball",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118095807

However, for middle- to older-age females less is known about the benefits of sports participation on these outcomes. Further, the acceptability and feasibility of setting-up, implementing and maintaining sports-based programmes for an aging population is an understudied area of inquiry. The current study used the RE-AIM framework to investigate a nationwide Walking Netball (WN) programme. Methods: The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach incorporating a multiple-baseline study, quasi-experimental study, programme monitoring data and qualitative studies to evaluate the programme in the Women’s Institutes (WI) in England. Data were analysed using multilevel growth modelling, mixed-design ANOVAs, multilevel regression, t-testing, and thematic analysis. Data were triangulated to address each dimension of the RE-AIM framework. Findings: The programme reached 1.4% (n = 3148) of the WI population across 82.0% of WI regions in England and attracted inactive members at risk of ill-health. WN contributed to adaptations in physical function, mental health and wellbeing, social isolation, quality of life and increased physical activity. The adoption of the programme was successful with 87.7% WN groups’ maintaining participation beyond the 20-session initial delivery phase. Adoption was effective because of its set-up, peer-mentorship and long-term delivery; these factors likewise shaped implementation. Adapting and tailoring WN to the varying characteristics of participants within the WI and the facilities available, along with training delivery staff and providing resources are key programme components. The Walking Netball programme can be maintained through promotion within the local community, sustainable funding, inter-WI competitions, festivals and networks, multiple-hosts and continued host development. Conclusions: WN was found to be an acceptable, feasible and effective intervention to increase physical activity and improve health in middle- to older- aged women. Future programmes may consider adapted styles of set-up and delivery. These include adapting to people, places and spaces through personalised support and providing a range of resources. Future designs may seek to understand how participation can contribute to healthy aging through longitudinal research beyond 12-months.

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate evidence of the effectiveness of neuromuscular warmup-based strategies for preventing lower extremity injuries among basketball athletes. Methods: PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched in February 2019. Studies were included if they were English-language randomized controlled, non-randomized comparative, or prospective cohort trials, tested neuromuscular and/or balance-focused warmup interventions among basketball players, and assessed at least one type of lower extremity injury as a primary outcome. Criteria developed by the USPSTF were used to appraise study quality, and GRADE was used to appraise the body of evidence for each outcome. Due to heterogeneity in the included studies, meta-analyses could not be performed. Results: In total, 825 titles and abstracts were identified. Of the 13 studies which met inclusion criteria for this review, five were balance interventions (3 randomized controlled trials) and eight were multicomponent interventions involving multiple categories of dynamic neuromuscular warmup (5 randomized controlled trials). Authors of four of the studies were contacted to obtain outcome data specific to basketball athletes. Basketball specific results from the studies suggest significant protective effects for the following lower extremity injuries: ankle injuries (significant in 4 out of the 9 studies that assessed this outcome); ACL injuries (2 of 4 studies); knee injuries generally (1 of 5 studies); and overall lower extremity injuries (5 of 7 studies). All but one of the non-significant results were directionally favorable. Evidence was moderate for the effect of multicomponent interventions on lower extremity injuries generally. For all other outcomes, and for balance-based interventions, the quality of evidence was rated as low. Conclusion: Overall, the evidence is supportive of neuromuscular warmups for lower extremity injury prevention among basketball players. However, most studies are underpowered, some used lower-quality research study designs, and outcome and exposure definitions varied.

However, poor LPC has not been studied as a risk factor for lower limb injury in sports requiring frequent jump landings. The present study investigated the effects of LPC on landing mechanics and lower limb muscle activity in professional athletes engaged in sport requiring frequent landing. Methods: This study was conducted on 34 professional female athletes aged 18.29 ± 3.29 years with the height and body mass of 173.5 ± 7.23 cm and 66.79 ± 13.37 kg, respectively. The landing error scoring system (LESS) and ImageJ software were used to assess landing mechanics. Wireless electromyography was also used to record the activity of the gluteus medius (GMed), rectus femoris, and semitendinosus. Lumbopelvic control was evaluated using the knee lift abdominal test, bent knee fall-out, active straight leg raising, and the PRONE test using a pressure biofeedback unit. Based on the LPC tests results, the participants were divided into two groups of proper LPC (n = 17) and poor LPC (n = 17). Results: There were significant differences between the groups with proper and poor LPC in terms of the LESS test scores (P = 0.0001), lateral trunk flexion (P = 0.0001), knee abduction (P = 0.0001), knee flexion (P = 0.001), trunk flexion (P = 0.01), and GMed muscle activity (P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in the activity of the rectus femoris and semitendinosus muscles, and ankle dorsiflexion (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Poor lumbopelvic control affects the kinematics and activity of the lower limb muscles, and may be a risk factor for lower limb injuries, especially of the knee. © 2021, The Author(s).","Jump-landing; Landing mechanics; Lower limb injury; Lumbopelvic control","abduction; accident prevention; adult; ankle; Article; athletic performance; ball sports athlete; basketball player; biofeedback; body height; body mass; case control study; clinical article; contact time; controlled study; electromyography; female; gluteus medius muscle; handball player; human; kinematics; knee function; leg muscle; motor control; muscle contraction; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; professional athlete; rectus femoris muscle; risk factor; scoring system; semitendinous muscle; trunk; volleyball player; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113648448

Methods: In Germany, injuries are registered with the statutory accident insurance for professional athletes (VBG) by clubs or club physicians as part of occupational accident reporting. Moderate and severe injuries (absence of > 7 days) sustained during basketball competition in one of four seasons (2014–2017 and 2018–2019) in the first or second national men’s league in Germany were prospectively analyzed using a newly developed standardized observation form. Season 2017–2018 was excluded because of missing video material. Results: Video analysis included 175 (53%) of 329 moderate and severe match injuries. Contact patterns categorized according to the different body sites yielded eight groups of typical injury patterns: one each for the head, shoulders, and ankles, two for the thighs, and three for the knees. Injuries to the head (92%), ankles (76%), shoulders (70%), knees (47%), and thighs (32%) were mainly caused by direct contact. The injury proportion of foul play was 19%. Most injuries (61%) occurred in the central zone below the basket. More injuries occurred during the second (OR 1.8, p = 0.018) and fourth quarter (OR 1.8, p = 0.022) than during the first and third quarter of the match. Conclusion: The eight identified injury patterns differed substantially in their mechanisms. Moderate and severe match injuries to the head, shoulders, knees, and ankles were mainly caused by collision with opponents and teammates. Thus, stricter rule enforcement is unlikely to facilitate safer match play. © 2021, The Author(s).","Contact; Epidemiology; Injury prevention; Match load; Mechanism; Non-contact","accident insurance; adult; ankle injury; Article; basketball; collision sport; controlled study; data analysis software; disease severity; Germany; head injury; human; intrarater reliability; knee injury; male; occupational accident; professional athlete; prospective study; shoulder injury; sport injury; thigh injury; videorecording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112819446

This study compares acute and overuse injuries using a nationally representative sample of high school athletes. Methods: Injuries among United States high school athletes participating in 5 boys’ sports (football, soccer, basketball, wrestling, baseball) and 4 girls’ sports (soccer, volleyball, basketball, softball) reported in the High School RIO™ surveillance system during the 2006-07 through 2018-19 school years were classified as acute or overuse. National estimates and injury rates were calculated. Results: Of 17 434 646 estimated injuries, 92.0 % were acute and 8.0 % were overuse. The acute injury rate was higher than the overuse injury rate among both male (Rate Ratio [RR] 16.38, 95 % CI: 15.70–17.10) and female (RR 8.14, 95 % CI: 7.71–8.60) athletes. The overuse injury rate per 10,000 athlete exposures among female athletes (1.8) was slightly higher than among males (1.4). The rate of acute injury compared with the rate of overuse injury was higher during competition (RR 32.00, 95 % CI: 29.93–34.22) than practice (RR 7.19, 95 % CI: 6.91–7.47). Boys’ football contributed the most acute (42.1 %) and overuse (23.7 %) injuries among the 9 sports. Among female sports, girls’ soccer contributed the most acute (15.6 % of all acute injuries) and overuse (19.4 % of all overuse injuries) injuries. The lower extremity was most commonly injured in acute (48.9 %) and overuse (65.9 %) injuries. Ligament sprain (31.7 %) and concussion (21.0 %) were the most common acute injury diagnoses, while muscle strain (23.3 %) and tendonitis (23.2 %) were the most common overuse injury diagnoses. Compared with acute injuries, overuse injuries were more likely to result in time loss from sports participation of < 1 week among both boys and girls and across most sports. Acute injuries were more likely than overuse injuries to cause a time loss of 1–3 weeks or medical disqualification from sports participation. Conclusions: Acute and overuse injuries display many differences that provide opportunities for data-informed athlete preparation, treatment, and rehabilitation, which may reduce injuries and improve injury outcomes in high school athletics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Gender-Comparable Sports; High School Athletes; Injury Reporting","absenteeism; algorithm; Article; athletic trainer; athletics; basketball; comparative study; concussion; contusion; face injury; female; football; head and neck injury; human; inflammation; injury; ligament; ligament sprain; lower limb; major clinical study; male; multiple trauma; muscle strain; overuse injury; soccer; spondylolysis; sport; sport injury; sprain; tendinitis; tooth injury; volleyball; wrestling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112337026

However, no study to date has calculated the incidence rates of these deaths by sport. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the epidemiology of sudden death in organized school sports in Japan. Methods: Data submitted to Japan Sport Council (JSC) Injury and Accident Mutual Aid Benefit System between 2005 and 2016 were retrieved from JSC website for analysis (n = 1137). Case information on fatal incidents that occurred during organized school sports in middle and high school students were extracted for analysis (n = 198). Descriptive statistics about activity type, sex, sport, cause of death, and presence of on-site trained medical personnel were calculated using frequencies and proportions. Sudden death incidence rates were expressed per 100,000 athlete-years with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The overall incidence rate of sports-related death was 0.38 deaths per 100,000 athlete-years (95%CI = 0.30, 0.45). Only three cases (2%) reported having trained medical personnel on-site at the time of death. Most deaths were in male student athletes (n = 149/162, 92%), with 7.5 times greater fatality rate in male compared to female student athletes (incidence rate ratio, 7.5; 95%CI = 4.43, 13.22). Baseball (n = 25/162, 15.4%), judo (n = 24/162, 14.8%), soccer/futsal (n = 20/162, 12.3%), and basketball (n = 18/162, 11.1%) accounted for 53.7% of deaths. Accounting for the number of participants in the respective sport, the three highest average incident rates of death were reported in rugby (4.59 deaths per 100,000 athlete-years, 95%CI = 2.43, 6.75), judo (3.76 deaths per 100,000 athlete-years, 95%CI = 1.58, 5.93), and baseball (0.59 deaths per 100,000 athlete-years, 95%CI = 0.38, 0.79). The top three causes of death were sudden cardiac arrest (n = 68/162, 42.0%), head trauma (n = 32/162, 19.8%), and heat related injury (n = 25/162, 15.4%). Conclusions: In conclusion, the highest rates of sports-related death among Japanese student athletes were observed in the following: rugby, male athletes, and during practices. The leading cause of death was sudden cardiac arrest. © 2021, The Author(s).","Catastrophic injury; Exertional heat stroke; Head trauma; School athletics; Sudden cardiac arrest","accident; adult; Article; athlete; athletics; autopsy; baseball; basketball; cause of death; concussion; drowning; female; head injury; heart arrest; heat injury; heat stroke; high school student; human; ice hockey; incidence; injury; Japan; Japanese (people); judo; major clinical study; male; medical personnel; Monte Carlo method; mortality rate; posttraumatic stress disorder; resuscitation; retrospective study; rugby; soccer; sport; sport injury; student athlete; sudden cardiac death; sudden death; thorax injury; time of death; traffic accident; training; workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109966954

Efforts to promote the adoption and implementation of evidence-driven approaches to reduce injury risk among school-aged athletes are needed. However, there is limited research regarding the perceived barriers, facilitators, and adherence factors that may influence the successful implementation of effective warm-up routines among this population. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and focus groups to assess high school basketball coach and player current practices, knowledge, and perspectives about warm-ups and lower-extremity injuries (LEIs). We interviewed coaches (n = 12) and players (n = 30) from May to October 2019. Participants were recruited from public high schools in a joint school district in Southern California. Multiple coders employed thematic analysis of the data using validated methods. Results: Coaches and players reported regular engagement (e.g., daily) in warm-up routines, but the time dedicated (range 5–45 min), types of exercises, and order varied substantially. Players often co-lead the warm-up practice with the coach or assistant coach. Despite regular engagement in warm-up, players and coaches report multiple challenges, including (1) limited time and space to warm-up effectively at games, (2) a perception that young players are not prone to injury, (3) competing demands for coaches’ time during practice, and (4) coaches’ lack of knowledge. Coaches and players perceive that warming up before practice will result in fewer injuries, and many players are motivated to warm up as a result of their personal injury experience; however, they desire guidance on the ideal exercises for preventing injury and training on the proper form for each exercise. Conclusions: Regular involvement in basketball warm-up routines is common among high school teams, but the methods and time dedicated to these practices varied. Players and coaches are eager for more information on warm-up programs shown to reduce LEIs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Athletic injuries; Implementation science; Qualitative research; Team sports; Warm-up exercise","adolescent; adult; Article; basketball; basketball player; exercise; female; high school student; human; human experiment; knowledge; leg injury; male; motivation; perception; qualitative research; questionnaire; semi structured interview; social hierarchy; sport injury; thematic analysis; warm up; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106947057

Methods: Twenty-four professional basketball players from the first Tunisian (Tunisia) division participated in this study. The players were dichotomized by sex (males [GM = 12]; females [GF = 12]). Both groups completed a 4 weeks SSGs training program with 3 sessions per week. Psychometric (e.g., quality of sleep, fatigue, stress, and delayed onset of muscle soreness [DOMS]) and physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate frequency, blood lactate) were measured during the first week (baseline) and at the end of RIF (post-test). Results: Post hoc tests showed a significant increase in stress levels in both groups (GM [− 81.11%; p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.33, small]; GF [− 36,53%; p = 0.001, d = 0.25, small]). Concerning physiological parameters, ANCOVA revealed significantly lower heart rates in favor of GM at post-test (1.70%, d = 0.38, small, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Our results showed that SSGs training at the end of the RIF negatively impacted psychometric parameters of male and female basketball players. It can be concluded that there are sex-mediated effects of training during RIF in basketball players, and this should be considered by researchers and practitioners when programing training during RIF. © 2021, The Author(s).","Fatigue; Performance; Recovery; Stress levels; Team sports","lactic acid; adult; analysis of covariance; Article; athletic performance; basketball; basketball player; blood sampling; body mass; exercise; exercise test; fatigue; female; fitness; heart rate; human; human experiment; intermittent fasting; lactate blood level; male; maximal oxygen uptake; monitoring; muscle; normal human; overexertion; physiological stress; pilot study; post hoc analysis; psychometry; Ramadan fasting; sex difference; sleep quality; sports medicine; team sport; training; Tunisia; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106858515

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to evaluate the NK status of Division I Basketball (D1B) players /coaches in Lebanon. The objectives of this study are to assess the prevalence of inadequate NK; identify the gaps in NK, main sources of nutrition information, perceptions on sports nutrition and independent predictors of inadequate NK among D1B players and coaches in Lebanon. Methods: All D1B players (n = 184) and coaches (n = 16) in Lebanon were invited to participate in the study. Study participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that included questions on NK, resources and perceptions. A percentage of ≥60% of NK questions answered correctly was used as indicative of having adequate NK. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sample characteristics. The T-test and chi square test were used for comparisons of means and proportions, respectively. Logistic regression was used to explore the predictors of inadequate NK in D1B players. Results: The sample consisted of 178 D1B players (nM = 126; nF = 52) and 11 male coaches, resulting in survey response rates of 97 and 69%, respectively. Inadequate NK was found among about 80 and 54% of D1B players and coaches, respectively. Inadequate NK was found to be independently associated with lack of nutrition education in D1B players. Conclusions: Despite widespread lack of adequate NK among D1B players and coaches in Lebanon, our sports clubs do not have dietitians. Basketball sports clubs in Lebanon should start to budget for hiring a dietitian or carrying out nutrition education campaigns that are based on analyses of incorrect responses of our study participants. Findings of this study are of tremendous significance to D1B players in Lebanon in terms of improving the athletes’ physical health and performance. © 2021, The Author(s).","Basketball; Coaches; Knowledge; Lebanon; Nutrition; Players","adult; article; basketball; budget; cross-sectional study; dietitian; health; human; human experiment; Lebanon; major clinical study; male; nutrition education; perception; prevalence; questionnaire; sport nutrition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106250402

We utilise a database made up of 244 surveys, which has been designed to identify the spending generated by attendees by geographical areas. It is noticed that the host city makes an investment of economic and human resources in the organization of the event, but only gets 27% of the total economic impact. In this way, there is a leakage of 73% of the impact, 48% goes to the closest developed city and the remaining 25% of areas around the host city. The sustainability of the event for the host city is compromised, since it loses most of the economic benefit created by the event.

Based on relative peak strain and ground reaction forces, subjects were grouped as power sport athletes (basketball, cheerleading, football, gymnastics, soccer, and volleyball), non-power sport athletes (wrestling, baseball, cross-country or track and field, softball, or tennis), or non-athletes. Using anteroposterior views of the left hip formatted from dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, the alpha angle, head-neck offset ratio (HNOR), and lateral center-edge angle (LCEA) were evaluated longitudinally at the ages of 17, 19, and 23 years. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of hip cam morphology (alpha angle >55° and/or HNOR <0.17) or acetabular dysplasia (LCEA <24°) at the age of 23 years in all athlete groups. The relationships between physical activity level and hip measures (alpha angle, HNOR, and LCEA) from the ages of 17 to 23 years were examined using linear mixed models adjusted for sex.Results:Compared with non-athletes at the age of 23 years, power sport athletes had significantly greater odds of cam morphology according to the alpha angle (odds ratio [OR], 2.93 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02 to 8.41]; p = 0.046) and HNOR (OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.01 to 3.60]; p = 0.047), but not greater odds of acetabular dysplasia (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in the odds of cam morphology or acetabular dysplasia in non-power sport athletes compared with non-athletes (all p > 0.05). Higher physical activity levels were significantly associated with an increase in the alpha angle (beta and standard error, 0.77° ± 0.30°; p = 0.011) and a decrease in the HNOR (-0.003 ± 0.001; p = 0.003), but not the LCEA (-0.05 ± 0.15; p = 0.744).Conclusions:A higher volume of physical activity and participation in sports with higher peak strain and ground reaction forces during the process of skeletal maturation may increase the risk of developing cam morphology during late adolescence.Level of Evidence:Prognostic Level III.

However, the gender difference in learning from these two visual presentations has not yet been elucidated. Thus, this study aimed to explore the gender difference in learning basketball tactical actions from video modeling and static pictures. Eighty secondary school students (Mage = 15.28, SD = 0.49) were quasi-randomly (i.e., matched for gender) assigned to a dynamic condition (20 males, 20 females) and a static condition (20 males, 20 females). Immediately after watching either a static or dynamic presentation of the playing system (learning phase), participants were asked to rate their mental effort invested in learning, perform a game performance test, and complete the card rotations test (test phase). The results indicated that spatial ability (evaluated via the card rotations test) was higher in males than in female students (p &lt; 0.0005). Additionally, an interaction of gender and type of visualization were identified, supporting the ability-as-compensator hypothesis: female students benefited particularly from video modeling (p &lt; 0.0005, ES = 3.12), while male students did not (p &gt; 0.05, ES = 0.36). These findings suggested that a consideration of a learner’s gender is crucial to further boost learning of basketball tactical actions from dynamic and static visualizations. © 2021 by the authors.

Athletes may develop CRPS because of exposure to traumatic or overuse injuries. The aim of the present study is to review the available literature about CRPS type 1 in athletes. Materials and Methods: We searched two online databases (PubMed and Web of Science), selecting papers aiming at investigating CRPS type 1 (algodystrophy) in athletes. The analysis of databases was made considering original articles published until 30 June 2021, written in English. Results: Fifteen papers (12 case reports, 3 case series) were selected for a total of 20 clinical cases (15 females, 5 males), aged between 10 and 46 years (mean age 18.4 ± 9.8 standard deviation years). Patients included practiced different types of sport (soccer, athletics, gymnastics, basketball). The most involved anatomical sites were lower limbs, and time to diagnosis ranged from 2 days to 4 years. The most used treatments were pharmacological and physical therapies, but sometimes invasive approaches, as regional nerve, or lumbar sympathetic blocks, were provided. The main assessed outcomes were return to activity and pain. Conclusions: Our review suggests a higher prevalence of CRPS type 1 in younger people and in lower limbs than in general population but confirms the higher prevalence in females. However, the number of studies addressing CRPS in athletes is limited, as well as the number of involved patients, considering that only few and heterogeneous case reports were published about this topic. Moreover, the high prevalence of old studies (only 5 available studies in the last 10 years) might have influenced the choice of both assessment tools and management strategies. Despite these limitations, athletes showing disproportionate pain after sport-related injury should be promptly evaluated and treated through a multidimensional approach to avoid long-term consequences of algodystrophy. © 2021 by the authors.

Twenty-four professional male basketball players from the Tunisian first division participated in this study. The players were randomly assigned to an intervention group (INT; n = 12) or an active control group (CON; n = 12). Both groups completed a four-week SSG training program (three sessions per week). During the first and fourth weeks of the SSGs training, the two groups were evaluated to detect changes in technical performance, dietary intake, body composition, sleep quality index (PSQI) survey outcomes, RPE, heart rate (HR), and blood lactate concentration [La]. During the fourth week of the RIF period, body composition, dietary intake, sleep latency, sleep duration, and HR significantly decreased only for INT (p < 0.001). However, RPE significantly increased (p < 0.001), and technical performances were negatively affected (p < 0.01). MANCOVA (adjusted for the percentage of change in sleep duration, body mass, and RPE) showed no significant differences in either group. In conclusion, our results showed that the technical performance of professional basketball male players was significantly affected at the end of RIF independently of changes in RPE, sleep habits, and body composition. © 2021 by the authors.

A descriptive observational study was conducted to determine the lower extremity flexibility profile of sixty-four basketball players and gender differences to identify players at higher risk of injury due to limited and asymmetric ROM in one or more movements. Participants: Sixty-four (33 male and 31 female) competitive athletes from the national leagues of the Spanish basketball league system participated in the present study (power of sample size ≥0.99). The eight passive ROM tests of the hip, knee and ankle were assessed using the ROM-SPORT battery. Each player completed a questionnaire on age, basic anthropometric data, dominant extremities, and training and sport-related variables. The lower extremity flexibility profile was established at 15◦ and 10◦ hip extension (HE), 39◦ and 38◦ ankle dorsiflexion with knee extended (ADF-KE), 40◦ and 39◦ ankle dorsiflexion with knee flexed (ADF-KF), 43◦ and 43◦ hip abduction (HAB), 75◦ and 61◦ hip abduction with the hip flexed (HAB-HF), 78◦ and 83◦ hip flexion with the knee extended (HF-KE), 134◦ and 120◦ knee flexion (KF), and 145◦ and 144◦ hip flexion (HF) by male and female basketball players, respectively. Sex differences in HE, HAB-HF, and KF were observed in BPs (p ≤ 0.01; Hedges’ g ≥ 1.04). Players reported limited ROM in ADF-KF, HE, HAB-HF, HF-KE, and KF; and asymmetric ROM mainly in HE, ADF-KE, KF, ADF-KF, and HF-KE.

This study aimed to quantify and compare, according to the teaching methodology and students’ previous experience, the external (eTL) and internal (iTL) load resulting from the application of three intervention programmes that follow different teaching methodologies to teach school basketball: the Tactical Games Approach (TGA), Direct Instruction (DI) and Service Teacher’s Basketball Unit (STBU). The Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPEs) recorded in the assessments (pre-test/post-test) were also studied. A total of 49 students, aged 11 to 12 and divided into three class groups, from the sixth grade of primary education at a state school in Spain, participated in the study. Teaching–learning programs were randomly assigned to student groups. All the sessions were monitored with inertial devices that made it possible to record physical activity and convert the information into kinematic parameters. The results indicated that during the sessions, the students who followed the TGA method recorded higher values of eTL (player load; DI = 4.92, TGA = 6.95, STBU = 2.99) and iTL (mean heart rate; DI = 142.94, TGA = 157.12, STBU = 143.98). In addition, during the evaluation tests, they presented heart rate levels similar to those obtained by the students in the other programmes. However, they spent more time doing high-intensity activity, working longer in the running (DI = 3.42, TGA = 11.26, STBU = 8.32) and sprinting speed ranges (DI = 0.00, TGA = 0.12, STBU = 0.11), and presenting better physical fitness. During the assessments, students with no prior basketball experience showed higher levels of top speed; experienced students had higher levels of heart rate. The TGA method favours the physical condition and health of primary education students, which is why this method is recommended when planning Physical Education sessions. © 2021 by the authors.

The exploration of innovative school-based PA intervention strategies to improve cognitive function and cardiorespiratory fitness is of great interest for researchers and school educators. This study aimed at examining the effectiveness of the coordinated-bilateral ball skills (CBBS) intervention in improving cognitive function and cardiorespiratory fitness among 4th-grade students. Methods: This study used a two-arm, quasi-experimental research design. The students (n = 347) in the intervention group received 16-weeks of CBBS intervention lessons in basketball and soccer. The students (n = 348) in the comparison group received 16-weeks of regular basketball and soccer lessons. All participants were pre-and post-tested with the d2 Test of Attention and the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER) test before and after the 16-week CBBS intervention. The data were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics and linear mixed models. Results: The linear mixed models yielded a marginal significant interaction effect of time with the group in their concentration (F(1, 680.130) = 3.272, p = 0.071) and a significant interaction effect of time with the group in their attention span (F(1, 785.108) = 4.836, p = 0.028) while controlling for age and the baseline concentration score. The linear mixed model also revealed a significant main effect of time in focused attention (F(1670.605) = 550.096, p = 0.000), attention accuracy (F(1, 663.124) = 61.542, p = 0.000), and cardiorespiratory fitness (F(1, 680.336) = 28.145, p = 0.000), but no significant interaction effect. Conclusions: The CBBS group demonstrated a significant improvement in concentration performance and attention span over time, compared to the comparison group. Both groups improved their focused attention and attention accuracy as well as cardiorespiratory fitness over time. This study suggests that teaching ball skills in team sports for extended periods is instrumental to developing cognitive functions and cardiorespiratory fitness, though the CBBS lessons resulted in greater improvement in concentration performance and attention span. © 2021 by the authors.

The study has two aims: first, to analyze the association between speed and acceleration variables (collected in the bench press (BP) exercise) and the distinct percentages of one-repetition maximum (1RM); second, to analyze the effect of a strength training protocol on wheelchair basketball (WB) players according to their functional impairments. Ten Spanish male WB players volun-teered to participate in the study. The players did a pretest and posttest (1RM in bench press) with 6-week muscle strength intervention program. The results showed a high association between the %1RM and the mean propulsive velocity (MPV) and the maximum velocity (Vmax), both in the total of the participants, and in each separate group of athletes. After implementing the strength training program, both the players of the IWBF (International Wheelchair Basketball Federation) < 2.5 group and those of IWBF > 2.5 group improved their 1RM (p < 0.01, ES = 0.20 to 0.23). However, the program produced positive effects at submaximal intensities in the MPV reached with 30, 40, 70, and 80 kg and in time to maximum velocity (TVmax) with 30, 40, and 70 kg (ES = −3.24 to 1.32) only in players with greater functional impairments. The high association between %1RM and MPV and Vmax can allow for determination the %1RM of the WB players in the BP using the MPV and the Vmax. The training program was effective in improving 1RM in both groups, while improvements in submaximal values only occurred in the IWBF < 2.5 group. © 2021 by the authors.

High school and collegiate athletes are at particularly high risk for sustaining a dislocation event. Despite the prevalence of these injuries, there is a paucity in the literature regarding incidence of sports-related shoulder dislocations and mechanism of injury within these populations. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to (1) determine the incidence rate of shoulder dislocations in high school–aged and collegiate-aged athletes presenting to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States; (2) to determine the most common sports associated with shoulder dislocations; and (3) to compare the current rates and risk factors for shoulder dislocation with previous trends. Methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System is a statistically validated injury surveillance system that collects data from ED visits as a representative probability sample of hospitals in the United States. We queried the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System for the years 2015-2019 to examine the following variables for sports-related shoulder dislocations: patient age (high school = 13-17 years of age; collegiate = 18-23 years of age), sex, year of admission, and sport type. Using a weighted multiplier, annual incidence rates were estimated based on the US Census estimates and injury rates were compared by sex and age group across the study period. Results: From 2015 to 2019, there were a total of 1329 athletic-related shoulder dislocations that presented to participating EDs. Of these, 698 (52.5%) shoulder dislocations occurred in collegiate athletes, while 631 (47.5%) occurred in high school athletes. Using weighted and adjusted estimates automatically generated by the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database, this translates to 89,511 total athletic-related shoulder dislocations across the United States (95% confidence interval lower bound 68,224; 95% confidence interval upper bound 110,798). Male athletes demonstrated a higher proportion of shoulder dislocations (87%) than female athletes (13%). The most common sport-specific mechanisms of traumatic shoulder dislocation were basketball (24.1%), football (21%), soccer (7.1%), baseball (7.1%), and weightlifting (3.3%). Conclusion: Sports-related shoulder dislocations are frequent in high school–aged and college-aged athletes presenting to the ED. Interventions to reduce incidence of injury should be sport-specific and focus on those participating in contact and noncontact sports. Male athletes have disproportionately higher rates of dislocation. These findings are consistent with the previous epidemiologic trends in the literature that have examined the incidence of shoulder dislocations in this population. © 2021","Case Series Using Large Database; Collegiate athletes; Epidemiology Study; Glenohumeral instability; High school athletes; Level IV; NEISS; Shoulder dislocations; Sports medicine","adolescent; adult; Article; baseball; basketball; boxing; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demographics; descriptive research; emergency ward; female; football; high school student; hockey; human; ice hockey; incidence; lacrosse (sport); major clinical study; male; retrospective study; shoulder dislocation; skiing; soccer; softball; sport injury; student athlete; swimming; United States; volleyball; weight lifting; wrestling; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116477507

It is also an exercise method used in training plan in terms of development of jumping ability in basketball players. There are many factors that affect squat performance both positively and negatively. These factors can vary as warm up, psychological and physiological conditions. In addition, squat performance may vary depending on warm-up types and intensity. It was aimed to determine the effect of different specific warm-up intensities on 1-maximum repetition squat performance (1-RM) on basketball players. Material and Methods The sample group of the study consisted of 10 men (age: 22.90 ± 1.44 years, height: 188.10 ± 8.06 cm, body weight: 77.92 ± 13.41 kg, BMI: 21.70 ± 2.83), who played basketball regularly for at least 3 years. This group performed 3 different specific warm up intensities on non-consecutive days. Warm up protocols were determined as follows: Light jogging for only 5 minutes (NSW), light jogging and % 40 intensity specific warm up (LISW), light jogging and % 80 intensity specific warm up (HISW). Results Participants’ 1-RM squat performance was found to be statistically different between NSW (91.10 kg), LISW (95.00 kg), HISW (100,50 kg) respectively (p<0.05). Additionally, 1-RM squat performance values were observed highest after HISW. Rate perceived exertion (RPE) and body temperature (BT) were found highest after HISW. Conclusions: As a result of this study, HISW are recommended to basketball coaches and basketball players in order to get more performance before the squat movement. © Özgür Eken, 2021.","Basketball; Intensity; Squat; Warm-up",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122829657

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether acute exposure to normobaric hypoxia is detrimental to balance performance in highly-trained basketball players. Nine elite and nine sub-elite male basketball players participated in a randomized, single-blinded, cross-over study. Subjects performed repeated trials of a single-leg balance test (SLBT) in an altitude chamber in normoxia (NOR; approximately sea level) with FiO2 20.9% and PiO2 ranging from 146.7 to 150.4 mmHg and in normobaric hypoxia (HYP; ~3,800 m above sea level) with FiO2 13.0% and PiO2 ranging from 90.9 to 94.6 mmHg. The SLBT was performed three times: 15 min after entering the environmental chamber in NOR or HYP, then two times more interspersed by 3-min rest. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) were recorded at four time points: after the initial 15-min rest inside the chamber and immediately after each SLBT. Across the cohort, the balance performance was 7.1% better during NOR than HYP (P &lt; 0.01, (Formula presented.) = 0.58). However, the performance of the elite group was not impaired by HYP, whereas the sub-elite group performed worse in the HYP condition on both legs (DL: P = 0.02, d = 1.23; NDL: P = 0.01, d = 1.43). SpO2 was lower in HYP than NOR (P &lt; 0.001, (Formula presented.) = 0.99) with a significant decline over time during HYP. HR was higher in HYP than NOR (P = 0.04, (Formula presented.) = 0.25) with a significant increase over time.

The summer and winter Olympic games will be held over a 7-month period in 2021–2022. Objectives: We took this rare opportunity to quantify and analyze the main bibliometric parameters (i.e., the number of articles and citations) across all Olympic sports to weigh and compare their importance and to assess the structure of the “sport sciences” field. The present review aims to perform a bibliometric analysis of Olympic sports research. We quantified the following topics: (1) the most investigated sports; (2) the main journals in which the studies are published; (3) the main factors explaining sport-specific scientific attractiveness; (4) the influence of being in the Olympic programme, economic weight, and local influences on research output; and (5) which research topic is the most investigated across sports. Methods: We searched 116 sport/exercise journals on PubMed for the 40 summer and 10 winter Olympic sports. A total of 34,038 articles were filtered for a final selection of 25,003 articles (23,334 articles on summer sports and 1,669 on winter sports) and a total of 599,820 citations. Results and Discussion: Nine sports [football (soccer), cycling, athletics, swimming, distance & marathon running, basketball, baseball, tennis, and rowing] were involved in 69% of the articles and 75% of the citations. Football was the most cited sport, with 19.7 and 26.3% of the total number of articles and citations, respectively. All sports yielded some scientific output, but 11 sports (biathlon, mountain biking, archery, diving, trampoline, skateboarding, skeleton, modern pentathlon, luge, bobsleigh, and curling) accumulated a total of fewer than 50 publications. While ice hockey is the most prominently represented winter sport in the scientific literature, winter sports overall have produced minor scientific output. Further analyses show a large scientific literature on team sports, particularly American professional sports (i.e., baseball, basketball, and ice hockey) and the importance of inclusion in the Olympic programme to increasing scientific interest in “recent” sports (i.e., triathlon and rugby sevens). We also found local/cultural influence on the occurrence of a sport in a particular “sport sciences” journal.

Although some benefits may be associated with early sport specialization, sports sampling is purported to be a more effective approach to the long-term health and wellbeing of children. Furthermore, the concept of developing what are commonly referred to as “fundamental movement skills” (FMS) is central to the rationale for delaying single sports specialization. However, in place of sports sampling, it appears that the practice of strength and conditioning (S&C) has become a driving force behind developmental models for youth athletes, highlighted by the growing body of literature regarding youth athletic development training. In this perspective piece, we explore how conventional S&C practice may insufficiently develop FMS because typically, it only emphasizes a narrow range of foundational exercises that serve a limited role toward the development of action capabilities in youth athletic populations. We further discuss how this approach may limit the transferability of physical qualities, such as muscular strength, to sports-specific tasks. Through an ecological dynamics lens, and using basketball as an example, we explore the potential for parkour-based activity within the LTAD of youth basketball players. We propose parkour as a training modality to not only encourage movement diversity and adaptability, but also as part of an advanced strength training strategy for the transfer of conventional S&C training. © Copyright © 2021 Williams, Strafford, Stone and Moran.","affordance landscape; fundamental movement skills; non-linear pedagogy; strength training; youth athletes","article; basketball player; human; juvenile; muscle strength; pedagogics; resistance training; skill",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118311925

By improving the understanding of injury incidence and risk specific to rookie players, sports medicine clinicians may be able to further individualize injury mitigation programs that address the unique needs of rookie players. Objective: To compare incidence and rate ratio (RR) of injury and illness among professional National Basketball Association (NBA) players in their rookie season with veteran players and to explore the association of sustaining an injury rookie season with career longevity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used an online data repository and extracted publicly available data about NBA players between the 2007 and 2008 season to the 2018 and 2019 season. Available data for initial injury and all subsequent injuries were extracted during this time frame. Exposures: Injury and illness based on injury status during the rookie season of professional NBA players. Main Outcomes and Measures: Injury and illness incidence and RR. Association of injury during the rookie season with career longevity was assessed via Poisson regressions. Results: Of the 12 basketball seasons analyzed, 904 NBA players were included (mean [SD] age, 24.6 [3.9] years; body mass index, 24.8 [1.8]). The injury and illness incidence for rookie players was 14.28 per 1000 athlete game exposures (AGEs). Among all body regions, ankle injuries had the greatest injury incidence among players injured during their rookie season (3.17 [95% CI, 3.15-3.19] per 1000 AGEs). Rookie athletes demonstrated higher RR compared with veterans across multiple regions of the body (ankle: 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.52; foot/toe: 1.29; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.61; shoulder/arm/elbow: 1.43; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.77; head/neck: 1.21; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.81; concussions: 2.39; 95% CI, 1.89 to 2.90; illness: 1.14; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.40), and demonstrated a higher rate of initial injuries compared with veteran players (1.41; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.53). Players who sustained an injury rookie season demonstrated an unadjusted decrease in total seasons played (-0.4 [95% CI, -0.5 to -0.3] log years; P <.001), but this decrease was not observed within adjusted analysis (0.1 [95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2] log years; P =.36). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, rookie athletes demonstrated the highest injury incidence at the ankle and increased RR across multiple regions. These findings may reflect differences in preseason conditioning or load variables impacting rookie athletes and warrant further investigation. Future research is needed to determine the association of cumulative injury burden vs a singular injury event on career longevity.. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Forty male basketball players were divided into two groups: Professional (PRO; n = 20) and Semi-professional (SEMI; n = 20). Participants completed the yo-yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-YoIR1), the squat jump (SJ), the counter movement jump (CMJ), the single leg drop jump (DJ), the 20-m sprint test, the planed multidirectional repeated sprinting test (PRSA5COD ), and the RRSA5COD test. Reaction time (RT) and movement time (MT), total time (TT), best time (BT), and fatigue index (FI) were assessed. Heart rate (HR) was continuously recorded, while rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and blood lactate concentration (LA) were measured post-tests. The reliability of the RRSA5COD test was also assessed between two attempts with one week between them. The RRSA5COD results demonstrated to be reliable with most of the variables showing ICC &gt; 0.80. BA Bonferroni post hoc revealed a significant better TT in favor of RRSA5COD (p &lt; 0.001; ES = 0.15; small), and in favor of PRO (p &lt; 0.001; ES = 0.006; small). The result showed a significant better performance in favor of PRO in all physical fitness tests. In conclusion, it was found that the RRSA5COD discriminates between professional and semi-professional male basketball players, and the results were demonstrated to be reliable. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all NBA players who had an ACL rupture between 2000 and 2019. Players were matched to healthy controls by age, position, body mass index, and player efficiency rating at the time of injury (index year). Player information collected included demographic information, position, team role, draft pick, date of injury, contract length, and earnings during the 3 years before and 7 years after the index year, as well as new contract length and earnings after injury. Results: A total of 12 players (22%) did not return to play (RTP). No statistically significant difference in annual earnings was present at any time point between cohorts. When we examined the mean difference in earnings between the first 3 post-index seasons and the 3 pre-index seasons, both the ACL and control cohorts showed increased salaries as players’ careers progressed, without a significant difference in earnings. When comparing cohorts, we found no significant difference in the length and earnings of contracts during the index year. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the length or earnings of the first new contract signed after the index year between cohorts. Additionally, NBA players who were able to RTP after ACL reconstruction were more likely to experience increased earnings if they had greater experience and performance prior to their injury (P <.01). Conclusions: Our study found that NBA players did not experience diminished earnings after RTP from an ACL reconstruction when compared with matched controls. Furthermore, no differences were seen in lengths of new contracts or in contract earnings between cohorts. Players with greater experience and performance prior to injury were more likely to have increased earnings after ACL reconstruction.

It is most commonly unilateral secondary to compression of the scrotal contents against the pubic bone. The majority of trauma to the scrotal region is blunt impact but serious injuries are rare despite the vulnerable position of the testicles. The combination of the cremasteric reflex and mobility/strength of the tunica albuginea contribute to reducing occurrences. However, serious injury can occur when the testicle is trapped against the pubic bone, varying from minimal extravasation to complete parenchymal destruction. Testicular rupture is a rare injury characterized by rupture of the tunica albuginea resulting in exposure of the seminiferous tubules. Prompt evaluation of these patients is crucial as a delay in surgical care may lead to loss of the injured testicle.

Fifteen male collegiate basketball players underwent a LIPC, RIPC, sham (SHAM), or control (CON) trial before conducting six sets of a 30-s Wingate-based SIE test. The oxygen uptake and heart rate were continuously measured during SIE test. The total work in the LIPC (+2.2%) and RIPC (+2.5%) conditions was significantly higher than that in the CON condition (p < 0.05). The mean power output (MPO) at the third and fourth sprint in the LIPC (+4.5%) and RIPC (+4.9%) conditions was significantly higher than that in the CON condition (p < 0.05). The percentage decrement score for MPO in the LIPC and RIPC condition was significantly lower than that in the CON condition (p < 0.05). No significant interaction effects were found in pH and blood lactate concentrations. There were no significant differences in the accumulated exercise time at ≥80%, 90%, and 100% of maximal oxygen uptake during SIE.

The purposes of this study are twofold: (a) to develop a methodological design in order to assess WB players’ performance, using wireless inertial measurement units (WIMU®) and a laser system (BioLaserSport® with computer vision), in a 20 m sprint test on court and (b) to assess bilateral symmetry as a performance indicator and for injury prevention purposes, the study of which in previous research is unknown. For both aims, the relation of the acceleration of the players’ wrists to the speed achieved by the player in the wheelchair was explored. Ten elite WB players participated in an on-court 20 m sprint test during real training. BioLaserSport® with computer vision was used to assess the average velocity (Va) and maximum velocity (Vmax) of the WB players, and two WIMU® were used for the total acceleration (AcelT) of the players’ wrists. A very high correlation was obtained in the assessment of the Va (0.97) and AcelT of both wrists (0.90 and 0.85). There was a significant relationship between the average AcelT of the dominant wrist and the Va on-court sprint velocity (p < 0.05). Two players did not show good wrist symmetry. In conclusion, a new methodological protocol was developed, making it possible to assess the bilateral symmetries in elite WB players in on-court real training and the relation between the acceleration of players’ wrists and players’ wheelchair speed.

Therefore, community sport settings are considered a promising location for health promotion. The aim of this project was to evaluate perceptions, knowledge and the impact (e.g., barriers and out-comes) of a healthy-canteen (cafeteria) display, based on traffic light labeling (TLL), which was set up at an Australian Basketball Association Managers’ Convention and Trade Show. (2) Methods: We set up a healthy ‘canteen display and surveyed Basketball managers on their perceptions of the display before (Survey 1) and after (Survey 2) visiting the display. Three months later they were surveyed (Survey 3) on changes made to their community sport canteens. (3) Results: Eighty-eight, 76 and 22 participants completed Surveys 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Participants believed stocking healthy foods and beverages was important (mean 8.5/10). Food waste, lack of consumer interest and price were identified barriers to stocking healthy foods. After visiting the display, 75% were inspired to make changes and 50% were surprised by the differences between their perceptions of the healthfulness of foods and the TLL ratings. Post-convention, 41% and 70% made or had planned healthy changes to their community sport canteen. (4) Conclusions: A healthy-canteen display is a low-cost, easy-to-implement strategy that may be able to direct self-driven improvement in the healthfulness of foods stocked at community canteens and lead to improved nutritional intakes at these venues. © 2021 by the authors.

The risk of injury to the neurovascular structures may depend on the type of sport involvement, although, sport-specific incidence rates are not known. Therefore, the goal of our scoping review was to provide some guidance to better inform the development of a context-fit stroke model by summarizing studies on a broad research topic related to stroke or cerebrovascular accident in sport based on a strict athlete definition. We used the guidance of Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage-process for a scoping review. Databases included MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R), and Embase (OVID databases); CINAHL Plus with Full Text, SportDiscus with Full Text (Ebsco databases); and Scopus. Publication dates were from 1979–2020 across nine different countries resulting in 39 individual cases of stroke with an athlete age range of 14–56 years (95% male). The major inciting event(s) prior to stroke onset were headaches (38.4%), head trauma (30.7%), and neck injury and/or vertebral artery dissection (20.5%). Several sporting activities were represented with American football as the most prevalent (30.7%). In summary, we found that sports with an aspect of impact, collision, or microtrauma can lead to subsequent stroke. These sport-related traumatic events were often difficult to diagnose because of the longer interval before ischemia occurred. Therefore, health care providers should be particularly attuned to the possibility of stroke when evaluating athletes presenting with or without neurological deficit. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: A retrospective review of all NBA players who underwent surgical management for AP from 1996 to 2018 was performed. A matched control group was created for comparison. The index period was defined as the entire NBA season in which surgery occurred, including the corresponding offseason. Player demographics, use (games played, games started, and minutes per game) and performance (player efficiency rating) metrics were collected for all players. Statistical analysis was performed to compare data before and after return to play. Results: Thirty players with a history of surgical management for AP were included in the final analysis. Following surgery for AP, NBA players were found to have a return to play (RTP) rate of 90.91% (30/33). The average RTP following surgery was 4.73 ± 2.62 months. Compared with control athletes, athletes in the AP group played significantly fewer seasons postinjury (4.17 ± 2.70 vs 5.49 ± 3.04 seasons, respectively; P = .02). During the first year following RTP, NBA players experienced significant reductions in game use and performance, both when compared with the year prior and matched control athletes (P < .05). At 3-year follow-up, players continued to demonstrate significant reductions in game use (minutes per game, P < .05) but not performance. Conclusions: Following surgical treatment of AP, NBA players demonstrated a high RTP rate, but shortened career. A short-term reduction in game use and performance metrics was found the year of return following surgery. However, 3-year follow-up performance metrics normalized when compared with healthy controls.

Relative exercise intensity (% oxygen uptake reserve) was quantified for two men's semi-professional basketball matches. Live play period durations were automatically determined using a moving average sample window and relative exercise intensity threshold, and manually determined using annotation of video footage. The sample window duration and intensity threshold were optimised to determine the input parameters for the automated method that would result in the most similarity to the manual method. These input parameters were used to compare the automated and manual active play period durations in another men's semi-professional match and a women's professional match to assess the criterion validity of the automated method. The optimal input parameters were a 9-s sample window and relative exercise intensity threshold of 31% oxygen uptake reserve. The automated method showed good relative (ρ = 0.95–0.96 and ICC = 0.96–0.98, p < 0.01) and absolute (median bias = 0 s) agreement with the manual method. These findings support the use of an automated method using accelerometry-derived relative exercise intensity and a moving average sample window to detect live play periods in basketball.

Methods: Sixty-two youth basketball players (age: 15.9±1.4yrs., height: 178.8±11.0cm, and body mass: 70.0±14.1kg) performed six trials of 505 COD test (with the left side being the plant leg first, then the right side). The completion time was measured simultaneously via timing gates (with error correction processing algorithms), the phone app, and stopwatches. Results: There was an almost perfect correlation and agreement between timing gates and COD timer (r=0.978; SEE=0.035s; and LoA=−0.08~0.06s), but a lower correlation and agreement between timing gates and stopwatch (r=0.954; SEE=0.050s; and LoA=−0.17~0.04s) with statistical significance in completion time (ES=1.29, 95%CI: 1.15–1.43, p<0.01). The coefficient of variation revealed similar level of dispersion between the three timing devices (timing gates: 6.58%; COD timer: 6.32%; and stopwatch: 6.71%). Inter-observer reliability (ICC=0.991) and test-retest reliability (ICC=0.998) were excellent in COD timer, while the inter-observer reliability was lower (ICC=0.890) in the stopwatches. Conclusion: In the 505 COD test, the COD timer was able to provide a valid and reliable measurement. On the contrary, stopwatch was not recommended because of large error. Thus, if timing gates are unavailable, practitioners can adopt the COD timer app to assess 505 COD speed times. © Copyright © 2021 Chen, Bian, Liao, Bishop and Li.","adolescent; basketball; change of direction; smartphone; timing device","505 Change of Direction Performance; adolescent; Article; basketball player; body height; body mass; concurrent validity; controlled study; correlation coefficient; health care personnel; human; interrater reliability; male; measurement accuracy; mobile application; observational study; physical performance; reliability; statistical significance; stopwatch; test retest reliability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116946845

Therefore, the goal to achieve in this study is to evaluate using a mixed method strategy the behaviors happening in the application of the technical–tactical means performed in the transition play of professional basketball in Spain. An ad hoc observation tool made of 11 criteria and 83 exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories (E/ME) has been designed and validated by means of data quality and generalizability analyses. Indexes obtained show high reliability and validity allowing the proposed actions to be recorded (correlation coefficients are above 0.95 and generalizability coefficients are above 0.90 in all cases). A total number of 128 situations corresponding to eight games of Unicaja de Málaga in the Endesa League in the 18/19 season were observed with the Hoisan software. The analysis of the relationships among behaviors was performed using the polar coordinates technique where the one-on-one initiation, outside the zone, has been used as focal behavior. The estimation of the functions representing the vectors has also been performed to model the best fit that estimates, starting from a focal category, the relationship among this focal behavior and the rest of the mating behaviors for possible future observations. The results show significant relationships between the selected focal behavior and the mating behaviors, showing indications of behaviors allowing tactical interpretation of the game and the definition of intervention programs to improve the performance of the team.

Methods: Eighteen college-aged male amateur basketball players participated in the project. Kinetic and kinematic data for DJ tasks were collected with force plates and infrared cameras. Raw data were processed to calculate knee joint angles and joint moments during DJ landing. Different components of core stability were represented by the sit-ups in 20 s (SU), trunk extensor endurance, trunk flexion and extension range of motion, dominant extremity single-leg stance time (DLS), and dominant extremity single-leg hop distance, respectively. Methods: Correlation and regression were used to determine the relationship between jumping-related biomechanical parameters and core stability components. Results: SU shared significant variance with the peak moment of knee extension (PMKE, p < 0.05), the peak moment of knee abduction (PMKA, p < 0.05), and the angle of knee internal rotation at initial contact (AKRI, p < 0.05). DLS shared significant variance with the angular motion of knee internal rotation (AMKR, p < 0.05) and the AKRI (p < 0.01). SU and DLS together could explain 52% of the variance observed in the AKRI, and the result was significant. Conclusion: Core stability’s strength and motor control aspects played an essential role in preventing knee injury during DJ landing. An integrative training program addressing core strength and motor control could be considered for coaches and athletes to prevent knee injury through core training and conditioning. © Copyright © 2021 Guo, Zhang, Wu and Li.","core stability; drop jump; knee injury; motor control; strength","Correlation methods; Dynamic light scattering; Joints (anatomy); Stability; Core stability; Drop jump; Injury risk; Internal rotations; Kinetic data; Knee injury; Motor control; Peak moments; Risk factors; Strength; Drops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116497121

Protocols, timings, and recovery strategies employed differed among teams. However, natural and physical recovery strategies such as sleep/nap, food/fluid replacement, active field, or gym-based cool-downs, use of supplementation, active or passive stretching, cold/ice bath/shower/immersion, massage, and foam-rolling were the most used among seventeen teams (>89%). Food and fluid replacement, showed a higher presence in the recovery protocols after competition and practice, always used by thirteen or more teams (~70%). The design and supervision of recovery are multidisciplinary tasks in 74% of the teams. Only two teams (11%) acknowledged not periodizing or individualizing recovery, while the other seventeen used these procedures regularly, considering different parameters, being previous injuries a factor always present. Teams not reaching the playoffs used a higher number of recovery strategies on average.

All clinical studies written in English, French or German, with a level of evidence of 1 to 4, and evaluating return to sport after shoulder arthroplasty, were included. ■ A total of 23 studies were included with 2199 patients who underwent hemiarthroplasty (HA), anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). Mean age was 68 years (range 18 to 92.6), sex ratio (male:female) was 1:1.5. The surgery was performed on the non-dominant/dominant shoulder in 1:1.8 cases. The mean follow-up was 4.2 years. The rate of RTS was 75.5% with a mean time of 7 months. It was 77.4% for TSA, 75% for RSA and 71.2% for HA (P = non-significant). RTS after shoulder arthroplasty is high, regardless the type of arthroplasty, with a trend for a higher rate after TSA. Patients who were able to maintain a sport activity pre-operatively had a greater chance of RTS after arthroplasty. Failure to RTS seems to be mostly linked to the severity of the underlying condition and length of preoperative disability. © 2021. The author(s).

A retrospective cross-sectional de-sign was employed, and a total of 1055 games from 20 world-level tournaments held between 2010 and 2019 were analyzed. The tournaments held in 2010 were played under the old three-point line (6.25 m), and the rest of the tournaments were played under the new three-point line (6.75 m). The numbers of two-and three-point shot attempts in each game were normalized to 100 possessions. Differences in mean values of two-and three-point shot attempts were analyzed by a two-way (cat-egory × year) between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences in the success rates of two-and three-point shots were analyzed by Fisher’s exact test. There was no significant category × year interaction for two-point shot attempts. However, there were significant main effects of category and year for two-point shot attempts. The number of two-point shot attempts increased significantly in 2012 and, in 2016, returned to a level not significantly different from that in 2010, independent of categories. There was a significant category × year interaction for three-point shot at-tempts. The number of three-point shot attempts decreased significantly in 2012 and, by 2016, returned to a level not significantly different from that in 2010 in senior men and under-17 women. There was no significant change in the number of three-point shot attempts in under-17 men. The effect of the extension of the three-point line on shot accuracy was limited. Differences in shot accuracy were prominent between age categories: the accuracy was lower in under-17 games than in senior games for both sexes. Although under-17 men attempted fewer three-point shots than senior men, under-17 women attempted a similar number of or more three-point shots than senior women. These findings can contribute to a better understanding of age and sex differences in recent trends in international basketball. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, this study aimed to characterize and identify the physical fitness level and profiles of basketball players according to sex. Total of 26 semiprofessional basketball players were assessed (13 male, 13 female) through inertial devices in different previously validated fitness tests. T-test for independent samples and principal component analysis were used to analyze sex-related differences and to identify physical fitness profiles. The results showed differences according to sex in all physical fitness indexes (p < 0.01; d > 1.04) with higher values in males, except in accelerometer load during small-sided games (p = 0.17; d < 0.20). Four principal components were identified in male and female basketball players, being two common ([PC1] aerobic capacity and in-game physical conditioning, [PC4 male, PC3 female] unipodal jump performance) and two different profiles (male: [PC2] bipodal jump capacity and acceleration, [PC3] curvilinear displacement; female: [PC2] bipodal jump capacity and curvilinear displacement, [PC4] deceleration). In conclusion, training design must be different and individualized according to different variables, including physical fitness profiles between them. For practical applications, these results will allow knowing the advantages and weaknesses of each athlete to adapt training tasks and game systems based on the skills and capabilities of the players in basketball. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of lockdown on the psychology, training, and sleep habits of a cohort of basketball players. An online survey involving 169 professional and amateur athletes was conducted using four validated psychological questionnaires (WLEIS-S, POMS, BRS, SMS-II) and a Likert scale to measure the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and training variables. Gender differences in fatigue (p = 0.022); friendships (p = 0.017); others’ emotional appraisal (p < 0.001); and resilience (p = 0.031) were apparent, with higher values for women in all categories bar resilience. Comparisons before and during the lockdown revealed that all participants reduced their RPE (p < 0.001); training days (p = 0.004); and training hours (p < 0.001), and experienced a decline in the quality of sleep (p < 0.001). Sleep hours (p < 0.001) increased during lockdown. The professionals and females maintained their training days (p > 0.05), while the non-professionals and males did not. Psychological states during lockdown were a predictor of the differences in training and recovery variables. In situations where training and competition are limited, it is important to develop plans to maintain physical activity, good quality sleep, and promote greater emotional management and understanding to control negative moods. © 2021 by the authors.

Saliva samples were collected from all participants at 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. on training days. Samples from the basketball group showed a significantly higher cortisol secretion. Moreover, from the second night, the pattern of cortisol secretion of these players was reversed, showing higher levels of cortisol in saliva at night than in the morning. The results suggest that the secretion rhythm changed over the course of the week and according to competitive demands. © 2021 by the authors.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to understand the characteristics of injuries on adolescent basketball athletes. METHODS: This study uses a descriptive method with a cross-sectional study approach using a web-based questionnaire (Google Forms) consisting of close-ended questions to examine the history, types, factors, and treatments of the injuries experienced by the adolescent basketball athletes at the Student Sports Training Center (Pusat Pelatihan Olahraga Pelajar or PPOP) of DKI Jakarta. The subjects are 14 male and female athletes with an average age of 15.9±1.1 years old, an average height of 172.29±9.33 centimeters, and an average weight of 65.71±10.06 kilogram. The research instrument is a questionnaire distributed online in the form of Google Forms. A validity test was conducted on the questionnaire using Aikens. Data Questionnaire result data were analyzed using a percentage analysis on the answers to each question in the questionnaire. RESULTS: The results revealed that 76% of the athletes experienced injuries in the lower limb, with the most frequent injury in the ankle joint (45%). Furthermore, the athletes also stated that sprains/twists are the most experienced type of injury (42%). The training sessions were when 79% of the athletes experienced their injuries, whereas the other 21% experienced them during the matches. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study cannot generalize the findings because it only involved 14 participants, which is also a limitation of this study, but these findings report that the greater injury that occurs during exercise is the ankle joint, so the authors suggest doing an adequate warm-up. Before starting a training session or during a competitive training session, preventing injuries is the best approach for athletes to reduce their occurrence. © 2021, BAHIANA - School of Medicine and Public Health.

Diathermy or Tecar therapy (TT) is a form of noninvasive electro-thermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy based on the application of electric currents. This technique is characterized by immediate effects, and its being used by high performance athletes. (2) Methods: A total of thirty-two participants were included in the study who were professional basketball players. There was a 15-person Control Group and a 17-person Intervention Group. TT was applied in the Intervention Group, while TT with the device switched off (SHAM) was applied in the Control Group. The effects were evaluated through the Lunge test, infrared thermography, and pressure threshold algometry at baseline, 15, and 30 min after the intervention. (3) Results: the Intervention Group exhibited a greater increase in absolute temperature (F[1,62] = 4.60, p = 0.040, η2 p = 0.13) compared to the Control Group. There were no differences between the groups in the Lunge Test (F[1.68,53.64] = 2.91, p = 0.072, η2 p = 0.08) or in pressure algometry (visual analog scale, VAS) (F[3.90] = 0.73, p = 0.539, η2 p = 0.02). No significant short-term significant differences were found in the rest of the variables.

It is an ex post facto study with a single-group retrospective design, with a representative sample of 94 coaches out of a possible 109. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and the short version of the ISTAS21 Psychosocial Risk Assessment at Work Questionnaire were adapted to the sports context. The results show that the youngest, those with the least experience and level 1 and level 2 coaches show the highest levels of stress. According to the psychosocial risk assessment, level 1 and 2 coaches, with experience between 6 to 10 years, are in the risk zone. Therefore, it is important to work with a group of coaches who are in the psychosocial risk zone and with high levels of psychological discomfort in order to avoid mental, emotional and physical stress, for the good performance of their work in the best possible conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

A prospective cross-sectional cohort study was conducted to determine the influence of hamstring extensibility (HE) on sagittal pelvic tilt, sagittal spinal curves, and LBP in 94 soccer and basketball players (61 man and 33 woman) with (n = 36) and without recurrent LBP (n = 58). Descriptive analysis displayed significant gender differences for HE, sagittal pelvic tilt, and lumbar curve. Differences were found between the low-HE and high-HE groups in lumbosacral angle in for the maximum trunk forward flexion (LH-MTFP). Low-HE was associated with LH-MTFP, lumbar curve and LBP in male players (p ≤ 0.023). In female players, LH-MTFP and lumbar curve were associated with low-HE (p ≤ 0.020). Low-HE predicted LH-MTFP (p = 0.000; OR = 65.6950) and LBP (p = 0.028; OR = 13.915) in male players. The decision tree analysis showed that 50.8% of the players were classified with restricted LH-MTFP, 77.4% with low-HE among male players. The 100% of male players with recurrent LBP had low-HE. The 65% of female players with low-HE had restricted LH-MTFP. Measurement of HE, lumbar curve, and LH-MTFP are important in making training decisions for to reduce the incidence of recurrent LBP in soccer and basketball players. © 2021 by the authors.

Following a randomized, counterbalanced design, ten participants (age: 16 ± 0.5 years) completed either VC or RTF separated by 72 h. VC consisted of 4 sets of 5 explosive repetitions (≥90% of the maximum velocity). RTF involved 2 sets of 10-RM (with no velocity control). Measurements of 20-m sprint, countermovement jump (CMJ) and medicine ball toss (MBT) were collected before (baseline), post 6 h and 24 h after either VC or RTF. Increases of CMJ post 6 h (VC, +6.7%; RTF, +2.4%) and MBT post 24 h (VC, +4.6%; RTF, +4.2%) were observed after both VC and RTF. Only VC potentiated CMJ after 24 h (+2.0 ± 2.3%).

This study aimed to analyze the possible relationships between resilience levels and the practiced sport according to gender, age, and competitive level of the athletes in 1047 competitive athletes from five different sports (handball, basketball, volleyball, athletics, and judo). Resilience was assessed with the Spanish version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). Results of independent samples t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant differences on the level of resilience according to the practiced sport or the competitive level. However, the analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that they were related to the gender and age of the athletes, being higher in males than in females, and there was a positive correlation with age. These results seem to suggest the convenience of using differentiated strategies, according to gender and age, when working on all those protective factors that could allow the athlete to perform better when facing adversity in the competitive environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Sixty-four male basketball players from five different age groups were monitored across eight regular-season home games. Physical demands were examined using a local positioning system and included total distance covered, distance >18 km·h-1, the number of accelerations (≥2 m·s-2) and decelerations (≤-2 m·s-2). All four game performance variables increased significantly (58.4 - 639.2%) when calculated with rolling average techniques in comparison to average physical demand values. Furthermore, the current investigation found that while Under-12 presented the highest result in relative total distance covered (p <.001; effect size = 0.58-2.01), they also showed the lowest values in the most demanding scenarios of match play and small-to-moderate effect sizes compared with their older counterparts. Both average physical demands and the most demanding scenarios presented an increasing tendency with age when distance >18 km·h-1 in basketball players was assessed. More specifically, the Under-12 age group achieved the lowest values and showed significant differences with the other four teams in both game analysis techniques (p <.001; effect size = 0.53 - 1.32). In conclusion, average game demands are shown to remarkably underestimate the most demanding scenarios of basketball match-play, and there are multiple significant differences between particular age groups. © 2021 Franc García, Julen Castellano, Xavier Reche, Jairo Vázquez-Guerrero, published by Sciendo 2021.","local positioning system; match demands; peak intensity; performance analysis; team sports","adult; article; basketball player; competition; deceleration; effect size; groups by age; human; intermethod comparison; male; physical examination; season; team sport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112648802

The main objective of the present study was to assess the magnitude of neuromuscular asymmetries in an elite youth female team-sports sample and determine its directionality. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the relationship between COD deficit, linear speed and COD time performance. Elite female youth basketball and handball players (n = 33, age = 16 ± 1.17 y) performed the Single Leg Countermovement Jump in vertical (SLCJ-V), horizontal (SLCJ-H), and lateral (SLCJ-L) directions, the COD and the 10-m sprint. Results showed statistical differences between limbs in all the neuromuscular tests (p < 0.001). The Kappa coefficient showed poor to fair levels of agreement between tasks (K range = -0.087 to 0.233), indicating that asymmetries rarely favoured the same limb between skills. Additionally, small and non-significant correlations were found between the linear sprint capacity and the COD ability. The findings of the present study highlight the independent directionality of asymmetries across tests. The COD deficit does not appear to be much more advantageous than COD total time to measure asymmetry. Practitioners are encouraged to use a fitness testing battery to detect existing side differences and each ability should be specifically trained with functional tasks. © 2021 Jordi Arboix-Alió, Chris Bishop, Ariadna Benet, Bernat Buscà, Joan Aguilera-Castells, Azahara Fort-Vanmeerhaeghe, published by Sciendo 2021.","imbalance; jumping; neuromuscular; performance; sprint; youth","adolescent; article; athlete; basketball; clinical article; female; human; jumping; juvenile; kappa statistics; leg; physician; skill; team sport; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112625511

The goal of Active Rehabilitation Camps (ARCs) is to use various forms of PA in order for the participants to obtain the greatest efficiency and independence in everyday life. (2) Purpose: To evaluate the improvement in physical performance of people with chronic spinal cord disabilities moving in wheelchairs taking part in the Active Rehabilitation Camp depending on (a) sex, (b) type of disability, (c) the level of injury and (d) the type of wheelchair. (3) Methods: The study included 42 wheelchair users: 28 men and 14 women aged 18–65 years (34.7 ± 14.9 years) taking part in the Active Rehabilitation Camp. Finally, the study involved 27 paraplegics, 9 tetraplegics and 6 individuals with myelomeningocele. The participants took part in four fitness tests: (1) sprint test (SP)—individual time to cover a distance of 15 m in the wheelchair; (2) slalom test (SL)—time to ride between four cones front and back; (3) basketball ball throw at a distance (BT), (4) zig-zag test (ZZ)—riding continuously for 6 min on the designated track. The tests were performed at the beginning and at the end of the ACR. Active wheelchairs were used by 32 participants, and 10 participants used the classic wheelchairs. (4) Results: Paraplegics achieved the best average results in all the tests and the best improvement in physical performance in comparison to individuals with myelomeningocele and tetraplegics. People in active wheelchairs achieved a statistically significant improvement in the results of SL and ZZ (p < 0.001). People with injury above Th-9 level of the spinal cord achieved a statistically significant improvement in the results of SP (p < 0.01), SL and ZZ (p < 0.01). People with injury below Th6 achieved a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in SP, SL and ZZ. (5) Conclusions: Regular PA during the Active Rehabilitation Camp improves the physical performance of disabled people in wheelchairs, but the scale of improvement of physical performance fitness depends on the type of wheelchair used and the level and the type of injury. © 2021 by the authors.

Physical activity is a well-known means of obesity prevention, but the relationship between exercise frequency and body composition in children has not been thoroughly investigated. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the body composition of children aged 11–12 who regularly performed swimming and other sports as an organized extra-curricular physical activity for a 12-week period. Methods: The study included 46 students who attended swimming classes and 42 students who participated in training activities in other sports, including, but not limited to, football, basketball and athletics. Body height and body composition were measured using a Tanita BC 418 MA analyzer. The students individually reported their rate of perceived exertion during training using the Pictorial Children’s Effort Rating Table PCERT scale. Results: The weekly volume of training was substantially higher in the group of swimmers than in that playing other sports (12.3 h/week vs. 5.2 h/week, p < 0.01). After 12 weeks of training, body height and weight significantly increased in both groups (p < 0.001). However, the BMI value and adipose tissue content only increased in the group of non-swimmers. Swimmers perceived greater exertion during training than non-swimmers (7.1 vs. 5.8 on the PCERT scale, p < 0.01). Conclusions: In early pubescent children, engaging in vigorous exercise such as swimming for at least 10 h a week may restrain the growth of adipose tissue. However, the variety of exercises that are typical of team sports, if performed for no more than 5 h a week, may be insufficient to restrain adipose tissue growth. © 2021 by the authors.","Body composition; Body mass index; Physical activity; Pubescence; Training",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113756344

A total of 294 students (Mage = 10.96 ± 0.76; 51.7% boys) from three elementary schools completed validated questionnaires assessing their perceived competence, self-reported PA, and PA enjoyment. Students’ actual ball skills (i.e., basketball, overhand throwing, striking) were measured by PE Metrics™. Correlation analyses showed positive relationships among the study variables (rs ranging from 0.12 to 0.56). The structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses demonstrated that the mediation model produces a goodness-of-fit to the data: χ2/df = 52.03/32; CFI = 0.96; NFI = 0.90; IFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.04. Path coefficients suggested that actual ball skill competence was strongly associated with perceived competence (β = 0.36, p &lt; 0.01), which in turn significantly predicted PA (β = 0.29, p &lt; 0.01) and PA enjoyment (β = 0.35, p &lt; 0.01). The findings highlight that ball skills significantly impact students’ perceived competence, positively and indirectly affecting their PA and PA enjoyment. This study provides empirical evidence that recommends intervention strategies aimed at fostering elementary school students’ PA and PA enjoyment. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the selection into and successful transition out of a national talent pathway in basketball is yet to be explored. Thus, the primary aim of this study was to explore the influence of relative age, gender, and playing time based on the selection into the Regional Talent Hubs and Basketball England youth teams (U16, U18, and U20) and the successful transition into the England National Senior Teams. Participants who were selected into the male (n = 450) and female (n = 314) Basketball England Talent Pathway were allocated into one of three cohorts: (a) Regional Talent Hubs (U12 to U15; n = 183), (b) England National Youth Teams (U16, U18, and U20; n = 537), and (c) England National Senior Teams (n = 44). A chi-square test was used to compare the birth quarter (BQ) distributions of each cohort against the expected distributions, with a Cramer’s V (Vc) used to interpret effect sizes. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated to compare the likelihood of each BQ being represented. Males revealed significant RAEs across both the Regional Talent Hubs (p < 0.001, Vc > 0.29, OR = 10) and England National Youth Teams (p < 0.001, Vc > 0.17, OR = 3.1). In comparison, females only had significant RAEs in the Regional Talent Hubs (p < 0.001, Vc > 0.29, OR = 2.3). Despite RAEs being prevalent throughout youth levels, there were no significant differences in the BQ distribution based on playing time and those who made the successful transition to the England National Senior Teams. These findings demonstrate the potential mechanisms of RAEs in basketball, as well as the impetus to explore more equitable competition structures within the England Basketball Talent Pathway. © 2021 by the authors.

The RSI and RSI-mod are most commonly derived from the performance of depth jumping (DJ) and countermovement jumping (CMJ), respectively. Given that DJ and CMJ are plyometric movements that differ materially from biomechanical and neuromotor perspectives, it is likely that the RSI and RSI-mod measure distinct aspects of neuromuscular function. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the association and agreement between RSI and RSI-mod scores. A mixed-sex sample of NCAA division I basketball athletes (n = 21) and active young adults (n = 26) performed three trials of DJ from drop heights of 0.51, 0.66, and 0.81 m and three trials of countermovement jumping. Using 2-dimensional videography and force platform dynamometry, RSI and RSI-mod scores were estimated from DJ and CMJ trials, respectively. Linear regression revealed moderate associations between RSI and RSI-mod scores (F = 11.0–38.1; R2 = 0.20–0.47; p &lt; 0.001–0.001). Bland–Altman plots revealed significant measurement bias (0.50–0.57) between RSI and RSI-mod scores. Bland–Altman limit of agreement intervals (1.27–1.51) were greater than the mean values for RSI (0.97–1.05) and RSI-mod (0.42) scores, suggesting poor agreement.

Thirteen trained basketball players were divided into the tDCS trial and sham trial by the random crossover design. The tDCS trial was stimulated with 2-mA current in the M1 area in the middle of the top of the head for 20 min. For the sham trial, the current was turned off after 5 s, stopping the electrical stimulation. After warming up, the players underwent countermovement jump test, weighted countermovement jump test and then performed 40 × 15-m sprints with with a 1:4 exercise: rest ratio. The jump height, sprinting time, fatigue index, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were analyzed by paired-sample t-test, when significance was discovered by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. The study results revealed that the tDCS trial significantly increase the countermovement jump performance (p = 0.04), decrease the sprinting time (p = 0.016), and had improved fatigue index during the sprinting process (p = 0.009). However, the heart rate and RPE during sprinting were nonsignificantly different between the trials. This study has identified that tDCS can decrease the speed decline, fatigue index during sprinting and increase countermovement jump performance without affecting heart rate or the rating of perceived exertion. © 2021 by the authors.

Currently, there are no studies that quantitatively analyse the open-ended questionnaire for knee injury-related fear in post-ACLR athletes. The purpose of this study was to identify knee injury-related fear in athletes who return to ball-centric sports via the use of an open-ended questionnaire. We aimed to determine the main concepts of injury-related fear according to sex, type of sport, and participation level. Methods: In this study, a quantitative analysis of an open-ended questionnaire was used to examine the type of fear athletes experience after returning to ball-centric sports. The RTS and fear questionnaire collected open-ended questionnaire to knee injury-related fear during sport activities; this questionnaire was completed at the outpatient visit post-RTS. Quantitative content analysis was performed to extract frequently occurring words from the responses to the questionnaire to create a co-occurrence network. The resulting co-occurrence network and extracted words were used to create concepts regarding knee injury-related fear. The relationship between each concept and subject demographics (sex, returned sports events, and participation level) were analysed using the chi-squared test. Results: Fifty-four athletes (30 females and 24 males) aged 16–45 [median age: 21.2; interquartile range (IQR): 11.0] years with an average RTS of 8.0 (IQR: 3.3) months from ACLR participated in the study. A total of 79 responses were included in the analysis. The knee injury-related fear can be summarized as follows: (1) Quick response to the opponent; (2) Ball-related play; (3) Jump-landing; (4) Contact; (5) Loss of balance; and (6) Athletic movement. Chi-squared tests showed that athletes participating in sport events with potential contact with an opponent (soccer, futsal, basketball, handball, lacrosse, and ultimate (frisbee)) were more likely to experience fear in quick response to the opponent (P < 0.01, adjusted residual = 2.943, ϕ = 0.301). Conclusion: The knee injury-related fear can be summarized into six concepts. Post-ACLR athletes participating in ball-centric sports need to assess fear in situations such as quick responses to the opponent's movements and ball-related play, in addition to simple movements such as jumping, cutting, and contact. © 2021 Asia Pacific Knee, Arthroscopy and Sports Medicine Society","Anterior cruciate ligament repair; Fear of movement; Fear of re-injury; Quantitative content analysis; Return to sports","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; athlete; athletic performance; ball centric sport; ball sport; basketball; clinical article; collision sport; content analysis; controlled study; demography; fear; female; human; jumping; knee injury; lacrosse player; male; open ended questionnaire; outpatient; patellar ligament; priority journal; psychological aspect; quantitative analysis; return to sport; running; semitendinous muscle; soccer; sport injury; Tegner activity score",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103736111

However, the rapid force production and relaxation during submaximal tasks is equally important for successful sports performance. This can be evaluated with an established rate of force development and relaxation scaling factor (RFD-SF/RFR-SF). The aims of our study were (1) to assess the intra-session reliability of shortened RFD-SF/RFR-SF protocol and its absolute and symmetry outcome measures, (2) to compare the main absolute RFD-SF/RFR-SF outcome measures (slopes of RFD-SF and RFR-SF: kRTD–SF and kRFR–SF, theoretical peak RFD/RFR: TPRFD and TPRFR) across gender and sports groups, and (3) to compare inter-limb symmetries across gender and sports groups for main outcome measures (kRFD–SF, kRFR–SF, TPRFD, and TPRFR). A cross-sectional study was conducted on a group of young health participants (basketball and tennis players, and students): 30 in the reliability study and 248 in the comparison study. Our results showed good to excellent relative and excellent absolute reliability for the selected absolute and symmetry outcome measures (kRFD–SF, kRFR–SF, TPRFD, and TPRFR). We found significantly higher absolute values for kRFD–SF and TPRFD in males compared to females for the preferred (kRFD–SF: 9.1 ± 0.9 vs. 8.6 ± 0.9/s) and the non-preferred leg (kRFD–SF: 9.1 ± 0.9 vs. 8.5 ± 0.8/s), while there was no effect of sport. Significantly lower symmetry values for kRFR–SF (88.4 ± 8.6 vs. 90.4 ± 8.0%) and TPRFR (90.9 ± 6.8 vs. 92.5 ± 6.0%) were found in males compared to females. Moreover, tennis players had significantly higher symmetry values for kRFR–SF (91.1 ± 7.7%) and TPRFR (93.1 ± 6.0%) compared to basketball players (kRFR–SF: 88.4 ± 8.7% and TPRFR: 90.9 ± 6.7%) and students (kRFR–SF: 87.6 ± 8.7% and TPRFR: 90.5 ± 6.7%). Our results suggest that the reduced RFD-SF/RFR-SF protocol is a valuable and useful tool for inter-limb (a)symmetry evaluation. Differences in symmetry values in kRFR–SF and TPRFR (relaxation phase) were found between different sports groups. These may be explained by different mechanisms underlying the muscle contraction and relaxation. We suggest that muscle contraction and relaxation should be assessed for in-depth inter-limb symmetry investigation. © Copyright © 2021 Smajla, Žitnik and Šarabon.","asymmetry; basketball; force; rapid movement; rapid strength; relaxation; tennis","adult; article; basketball player; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; gender; human; human experiment; leg; leisure; male; muscle contraction; outcome assessment; reliability; tennis; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109071473

Methods Quidel Sofia-2 SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Tests were performed daily before sports participation for football, basketball, wrestling and water polo from 29 September 2020 to 28 February 2021. Paired RT-PCR and antigen tests were performed at least once a week. Positive antigen tests were confirmed with RT-PCR. Results 81 175 antigen and 42 187 RT-PCR tests were performed, including 23 462 weekly paired antigen/RT-PCR screening tests in 1931 athletes. One hundred and seventy-two athletes had a positive screening RT-PCR (0.4%), of which 83 (48%) occurred on paired testing days. The sensitivity of antigen tests varied with the frequency of RT-PCR testing and prevalence of COVID-19. The sensitivity of antigen testing was 35.7% (95% CI: 17% to 60%) and specificity 99.8% (95% CI: 99.7% to 99.9%) with once-a-week RT-PCR testing after adjusting for school prevalence. Daily antigen testing was similar to RT-PCR testing two to three times a week in identifying infection. Antigen testing identified infection before the next scheduled PCR on 89 occasions and resulted in 234 days where potentially infectious athletes were isolated before they would have been isolated with RT-PCR testing alone. Two athletic-related outbreaks occurred; 86% of total infections were community acquired. Conclusion Antigen testing has high specificity with a short turnaround time but is not as sensitive as RT-PCR. Daily antigen testing or RT-PCR testing two to three times a week is similar. There are benefits and drawbacks to each testing approach. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

Methods Data of 529 athletes in the 1st year and of 495 athletes in the 2nd year of analysis were investigated from the injury record database of a sports club. The following data were considered: the demographic characteristics (age, body mass, height, and sex), the mechanism (contact or noncontact), the severity, the moment at which the injury occurred, and the recurrence. Also, the incidence rate, the injury risk of the first ankle sprain, and the incidence rate ratio between sports were calculated. Results The athletes sustained 124 ankle sprains in the 2 years of analysis. The majority occurred during training (76.6%) and lead to absence from sports practice (75.8%). The injury recurrence was low: 2 athletes (1.6%) had a recurrence in the same year and 5 (4.0%) in the following year. The incidence rate (0.79 to 12.81 per 1,000 hours) and the injury risk (1.14 to 19.44%) varied among sports. Volleyball, basketball, and futsal presented the highest injury rate incidence. Tennis, gymnastics, and trampoline showed the lowest injury rate incidence. Judo showed an incidence rate different from those of basketball and volleyball in the 1st year and similar to those of other sports in the 2nd year. Conclusion Ankle sprain greatly impacted sports practice and presented characteristics that differ among the investigated sports.

This randomized controlled study involved female athletes with dominant-leg CAI. The participants were randomly divided into three groups: WBV training (Group A), balance training (Group B), and nontraining (control group; Group C). Groups A and B performed three exercise movements (double-leg stance, one-legged stance, and tandem stance) in 6-week training programs by using a vibration platform and balance ball, respectively. The Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), a joint position sense test, and an isokinetic strength test were conducted. In total, 63 female athletes with dominant-leg CAI were divided into three study groups (all n = 21). All of them completed the study. We observed time-by-group interactions in the SEBT (p = 0.001) and isokinetic strength test at 30◦/s of concentric contraction (CON) of ankle inversion (p = 0.04). Compared with the control group, participants of the two exercise training programs improved in dynamic balance, active repositioning, and 30◦/s of CON and eccentric contraction of the ankle invertor in the SEBT, joint position sense test, and isokinetic strength test, respectively. Furthermore, the effect sizes for the assessed outcomes in Groups A and B ranged from very small to small. Female athletes who participated in 6-week training programs incorporating a vibration platform or balance ball exhibited very small or small effect sizes for CAI in the SEBT, joint position sense test, and isokinetic strength test. No differences were observed in the variables between the two exercise training programs. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to examine the effects of an eight-week bilateral coordinated movement (BCM) intervention on manipulative skill competency in school-aged children. Methods: The participants were 314 fourth-grade students from two elementary schools in China. This study used a two-arm quasi-experimental research design. For one elementary school, two fourth-grade classes were assigned to the BCM group and another two fourth-grade classes were assigned to the control group. For the other elementary school, one fourth-grade class was assigned to the BCM group and another fourth-grade class to the control group. The students in the BCM group received an eight-week, two 40 min BCM lessons in soccer, and another eight-week, two 40-min BCM lessons in basketball. The control group received an eight-week two regular 40 min PE lessons in soccer and basketball, respectively. The students’ manipulative skill competency in soccer and basketball skills were pre-and post-tested using the two PE metric assessment rubrics. Data were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, and ANCOVA and ANOVA repeated measures. Results: The results showed a significant main effect of time (pre-test vs. post-test) in soccer skills (F = 273.095, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.468) and in basketball skills (F = 74.619, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.193). Additionally, the results revealed a significant main effect of the group (BCM group vs. control group) in soccer skills (F = 37.532, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.108) and a marginal significant main effect of the groups in basketball skills (F = 3.619, p = 0.058, η2 = 0.011). Furthermore, there was a significant interaction effect between the time and the group in soccer skills (F = 37.532, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.108) and in basketball skills (F = 18.380, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.056). Conclusions: It was concluded that after participation in the eight-week, 16 40 min lessons of BCM, the fourth-grade students showed greater improvement in soccer and basketball dribbling, passing and receiving skills, compared to the control group. © 2021 by the authors.

These practices include screening for injury, having appropriate emergency medical care, and protocols for managing injury before return-to-play. The extent of the uptake of these practices in a developing country such as Uganda, is unknown. Methodology: Using a descriptive case study approach, this investigation focused on a sample of injured athletes (n = 75) in Uganda from four main sports associations (football, athletics, basketball and rugby). The data were collected through observations and interviews after the injury. Using a best medical practice framework the phases of emergency, intermediate, rehabilitative, and return-to-sports participation were described. Result: Nine conditions/types of injury were included. The results revealed a lack of specific pre-season screening or return- to-play readiness for all the injured athletes. Further, there was a lack of application of best practice principles for most of the injury types. For athletes who received medical care, the results show inconsistencies and inadequacies from the acute stage of the injury to return-to-sports participation. Conclusion: This study identified barriers such as up-to-date knowledge among the sports resource providers; the gaps for appropriate and adequate specific facilities for managing injured athletes, and policies to mandate care of injured athletes. These barriers detract from applying best medical practices. © 2021 Lubega SK et al.","Emergency; Injuries; Intermediate; Medical; Rehabilitation; Return-to-sports; Uganda","analgesic agent; adult; anamnesis; Article; athlete; athletics; basketball; case study; clinical observation; cohort analysis; controlled study; cryotherapy; descriptive research; emergency treatment; female; football; good clinical practice; health care policy; human; immobilization; major clinical study; male; massage; prospective study; rehabilitation care; return to sport; rugby; sport injury; sports medicine; sprain; stretching exercise; Uganda; interview; observation; psychology; qualitative research; young adult; Adult; Athletes; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Observation; Prospective Studies; Qualitative Research; Sports Medicine; Uganda; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112219275

The study used empirical methods of measuring heart rate during competitions, pulmonary ventilation values, О2 consumption during physical work, О2-debt, “excess” CО2 emissions and individual pulse rates, methods of mathematical statistics. Results. Relationships between the level of physical activity and physiological shifts in the body of basketball players have been established. It is revealed that indicators of pulmonary ventilation can be used to control the training effect of aerobic exercise. Exercises of anaerobic glycolytic orientation have been shown to have the most pronounced effect on the body of basketball players. There are certain mean and limit values for different physiological parameters, characteristic of different ranges of training loads. Conclusions. It is established that in assessing the urgent training effect of special exercises of basketball players, different physiological indicators have different “distinguishing power”.

For most sports there are few recommendations based on scientific evidence for returning to team-game activities following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the extended duration of lockdown, and self-training or detraining in the COVID-19 environment, and this is especially true for basketball. A post-lockdown return to the basketball court ultimately depends on the teams— coaches, trainers, players, and medical staff. Nevertheless, our current scientific knowledge is evidently insufficient as far as safety and return-to-play timing are concerned. This situation presents a major challenge to basketball competition in terms of organization, prioritization, maintaining physical fitness, and decision-making. While preparing an adequate basketball return program, the players’ health is the major priority. In this article we briefly discuss the topic and propose multiple strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, sleep is identified as an important factor that has a profound effect on children’s athletic performance. If a short daytime nap is shown to benefit children involved in sports activities, this evidence could be used to improve children’s athletic performance in the afternoon. In this study, we investigated whether a short daytime nap could reduce the decline in athletic performance observed in the afternoon in children involved in basketball games. We investigated 10 elementary school-age male basketball players. The study was performed under two conditions, with and without a 20-min nap during the lunch break, and evaluation was performed under both conditions for 3 days each. The reaction and 20-m sprint times were measured after morning practice, before afternoon practice, and at the end of practice on all days. At the beginning of afternoon practice, the 20-m sprint time was significantly shorter (p<0.05) in the no-nap group (4.18±0.27 s) than in the nap group (4.24±0.24 s).

Forty collegiate basketball students, divided into faster and slower performers and high-playing-level and low-playing-level groups, were evaluated for the force-time characteristics (braking and/or propulsive phase) of the penultimate foot contact (PFC), final foot contact (FFC), and first accelerating foot contact (AFC), and for completion time and approach velocity. Based on the composition of the AFC, trials were classified as braking/propulsive or only propulsive. Regression analysis for the prediction of completion time was performed. The AFC contributed to reacceleration through shorter contact times and step length, and lower braking force production (p < 0.05). Faster performers and the high-playing-level group demonstrated (p < 0.05): lower completion times, higher approach velocities, longer steps length in the PFC and FFC, greater braking forces and impulses in the PFC; greater braking and propulsive forces, braking impulses, lower contact times in the FFC; greater braking and propulsive horizontal forces, horizontal impulses, lower contact times and vertical impulses in the AFC. Kinetic variables from only the FFC and AFC and approach velocity predicted 75% (braking/propulsive trials) and 76.2% (only-propulsive trials) of completion times. The characterization of the turning phase demonstrated the specific contribution of each foot contact and the possible implications for training prescription. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of this study was to explore whether masters athletes' social and psychological experiences vary with their time, frequency, and perceived exertion in training and competition. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 men and women older masters athletes, aged 50–79 years (M = 66), who were active at the competitive level across a variety of sports (e.g., volleyball, curling, rowing, dragon boating, running, swimming, and basketball) at the time of the study. Results indicate that all participants experienced social and psychological benefits from engaging in masters sport. Only the high-frequency engagement subgroup (participating five to seven times per week in training and/or competition) reported social downsides, in terms of missing time with family and friends outside of masters sport. However, some participants described the positive family support (e.g., spouse who endorses sport participation) that overrides some of the social costs. These findings have implications for realizing positive experiences with minimal engagement in masters sport, yet an apparent threshold of participation beyond which negative social consequences may be experienced.

This study investigated the effect of pre-step lower-limb loading and unloading with preparatory knee flexion-extension movements on sidestepping performance in fifteen male collegiate basketball players. Participants performed two-choice (step limb) reaction time sidestepping under two conditions: without preparatory movements before the go cue (no-prep–NP) and with continuous alternating knee extension and flexion movements (prep–P). The reaction signal was provided at the beginning of knee extension and flexion and during these movements which corresponded with the largest and smallest loading instants and the transition states between those instants. Sidestepping performance was assessed with three-dimensional kinematic data and ground reaction forces. Step initiation onset time was significantly faster by 13–15% than the NP condition when initiated in the knee flexion phase (p ≤ 0.028, r ≥ 0.70), whereas step-limb unloading interval from step initiation to step lift-off was significantly faster by 12–15% in the knee extension phase (p ≤ 0.01, r ≥ 0.74). The preparatory movements significantly shortened step lift-off by 10–12% (p ≤ 0.013, r ≥ 0.73) and step duration by 17–21% (p < 0.001, r ≥ 0.85) with 19–22% faster step velocity (p < 0.001, r ≥ 0.84), which resulted in 14–15% shorter overall time to step landing (p < 0.001, r ≥ 0.84), irrespective of the loading phases. These results indicated that lower-limb loading with pre-step knee flexion facilitated faster step initiation, while lower-limb unloading with knee extension facilitated faster step-limb unloading, both resulting in faster step lift-off. Bilateral knee flexion-extension movements as a preparatory action could be utilized by invasion sports players to facilitate reactive stepping performance for more effective movement initiation.

Gender differences were considered. Twenty-seven players from an international high-level basketball club (14 female, 16.00 ± 0.55 years; 13 male, 15.54 ± 0.52 years) participated in this cross-sectional study. Rate of force development was evaluated by means of the Abalakov test (bilateral: AbB; right leg: AbR; left leg: AbL); and the triple hop test (right leg: THR; left leg: THL). Blood samples were collected for the determination of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and nutritional status. Vitamin D insufficiency was found in both women (29.14 ± 6.08 ng/mL) and men (28.92 ± 6.40 ng/mL), with no gender differences regarding nutritional scores. Jumping and hopping performance was confirmed to be significantly larger in males (AbL, THR, and THL p < 0.005), whose CV% were always smaller. A positive correlation was found between AbB and vitamin D (r = 0.703) in males, whereas this correlation was negative (−0.611) for females, who also presented a negative correlation (r = −0.666) between THR and vitamin D. A prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was confirmed in young elite athletes training indoors. Nutritional (i.e., calciferol) controls should be conducted throughout the season. Furthermore, whilst performance seems to be affected by low levels of this vitamin in men, these deficiencies appear to have a different association with jumping and hopping in women, pointing to different performance mechanisms. Further studies accounting for differences in training and other factors might delve into these gender differences. © 2021 by the authors.

In particular, such abilities seem to rely on processing others’ intentions to act. We adopted a new approach based on an attentional spatial compatibility paradigm to investigate how elite volleyball players elaborate both spatial and motor information at upperlimb posture presentation. Forty-two participants (18 volleyball players and 17 nonathlete controls assigned to Experiments 1 a and b, and eight basketball players assigned to Experiment 2) were tested to study their ability to process the intentions to act conveyed by hands and extract motor primitives (i.e., significant components of body movements). Analysis looked for a spatial compatibility effect between direction of the spike action (correspondence factor) and response side for both palm and back of the hand (view factor). We demonstrated that volleyball players encoded spatial sport-related indices from bodily information and showed preparatory motor activation according to the direction of the implied spike actions for the palm view (Experiment 1; hand simulating a cross-court spike, p = 0.013, and a down-the-line spike, p = 0.026) but both nonathlete controls (Experiment 1; both p < 0.05) and other sports athletes (basketball players, Experiment 2; p = 0.34, only cross-court spike) did not.

We finally assigned 30 preschool children with ASD to an experiment group (n = 15, 12 males, 3 females) or a control group (n = 15, 13 males, 2 females). The experiment group participated in a 12-week MBTP (40-min sessions per day, 5 days a week), while the control group only received the institutional routine behavioral rehabilitation intervention. The SC of preschool children with ASD was measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2), whereas functional connectivity (FC) of the ECN was assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) at pre-and post-test. Our results showed that SC exhibited significant improvement in the intervention group, especially in SRS-2 total score, social cognition, and social communication. We found significantly enhanced functional connectivity between the right cerebellum and left inferior frontal gyrus in the experimental group, while functional connectivity between the left middle temporal gyrus and right cerebellum were decreased in the control group. Furthermore, there were no significant correlations between the change in SC scores and FC of the ECN. Altogether, this study provides valuable insights that a 12-week MBTP improves SC and functional connectivity of the ECN in preschool children with ASD. We further inferred that neural mechanisms might be associated with changing the ECN of preschool ASD children caused by the 12-week MBTP. © 2021 by the authors.

There are differences between the performance profiles of students in the Direct Instruction in Basketball program and those in the Tactical Game in Basketball program in nine variables. Significant differences are found in the situations of dribbling, shooting, passing and movement, spacing, off-ball defense, and help and in the performance indicator for decision making, execution, and total, which are favorable to the Tactical Game in Basketball program. The students of the Direct Instruction in Basketball program only improved in three variables after the program, while the Tactical Game in Basketball students improved in thirteen variables. It is recommended that the teachers at the schools use the Tactical Game in Basketball methodology for their basketball teaching lessons, because student learning is better than in the Direct Instruction in Basketball program. © 2021 by the authors.

Wearable technology enables the workload to be monitored in sport settings. However, workload–injury models lack a biological basis both in the metrics recorded and how workload is accumulated. We introduce a new metric for monitoring workload: weighted jump height, where each jump height is weighted to represent the expected effect of the jump magnitude on damage to the tendon. The objectives of this study were to use principal components analysis to identify distinct modes of variation in all workload metrics accumulated over 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and to examine differences among the modes of variation in workload metrics between participants before the injury and uninjured participants. Forty-nine youth basketball players participated in their typical basketball practices and games, and lower extremity injuries were classified as patellar or Achilles tendinopathy, other overuse, or acute. An inertial measurement unit recorded the number and height of all jumps, and session rating of perceived exertion was recorded. The previous 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-week workloads of jump count, jump height, weighted jump height, and session rating of perceived exertion were summed for each participant-week. Principal components analysis explained the variance in the accumulated workload variables. Using the retained principal components, the difference between the workload of injured participants in the week before the injury and the mean workload of uninjured participants was described for patellar or Achilles tendinopathy, overuse lower extremity injury, and any lower extremity injury. Participants with patellar or Achilles tendinopathy and overuse lower extremity injuries had a low workload magnitude for all variables in the 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks before injury compared with the weeks before no injury. Participants with overuse lower extremity injuries and any lower extremity injury had a high previous 1-week workload for all variables along with a low previous 3- and 4-week jump count, jump height, and weighted jump height before injury compared with the weeks before no injury. Weighted jump height represents the cumulative damage experienced by tissues due to repetitive loads. Injured youth basketball athletes had a low previous 3- and 4-week workloads coupled with a high previous 1-week workload.

However, no such research have been published in the literature, particularly using the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The aim of this study is to build an ANN model with an app for automatic prediction and classification of HOF for NBA players. We downloaded 4728 NBA players’ data of career stats and accolades from the website at basketballreference.com. The training sample was collected from 85 HOF members and 113 retired Non-HOF players based on completed data and a longer career length (≥15 years). Featured variables were taken from the higher correlation coefficients (<0.1) with HOF and significant deviations apart from the two HOF/Non-HOF groups using logistical regression. Two models (i.e., ANN and convolutional neural network, CNN) were compared in model accuracy (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC). An app predicting HOF was then developed involving the model’s parameters. We observed that (1) 20 feature variables in the ANN model yielded a higher AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.93–0.97) based on the 198-case training sample, (2) the ANN performed better than CNN on the accuracy of AUC (= 0.91, 95% CI 0.87–0.95), and (3) an ready and available app for predicting HOF was successfully developed.

Therefore, the aims of the present study were: (i) to investigate the differences in biological maturation and anthropometric and morphological characteristics among three groups of Italian adolescents, two of which were sportive (practicing basketball and football) and one non-sportive, and (ii) to identify the anthropometric and morphological predictors that best discriminate these three groups. Methods: Sixty-one basketball and 62 soccer players and 68 non-sportive youths were measured (mean age = 13.0 ± 1.1 y). Anthropo-metric characteristics were taken and body mass index, cormic index, body composition parameters, and somatotype were derived. An estimation of maturity status was carried out considering the years from peak height velocity (PHV). Two-way 3 × 3 ANOVAs was performed on all anthropometric characteristics to test the differences within sport groups and maturity status groups. Discriminant function analysis (stepwise criteria) was then applied to anthropometric and body composition variables to classify subjects into the three different sport categories. Results: Differences in anthropo-metric characteristics were detected among the three groups. For somatotype, differences among all of the considered groups were higher for endomorphy (p < 0.001; effect size = 0.13). Biological maturity influences the differences in the anthropometric characteristics and body composition among subjects of the same chronological age during adolescence. The variables that best discriminated the three groups were represented by body composition parameters, body proportions, and body build. Conclusions: This study confirms that boys who practice sport present healthier body composition parameters, with lower level of fat parameters. The assessment of maturity status is a fundamental factor in explaining anthropometric and body composition differences among peers in this period. Its comprehension may assist coaches and technical staff in optimizing competitive efficiency and monitoring the success of training regimes. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: Professional athletes from the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL who underwent shoulder arthroscopy between January 1998 and December 2016 were identified through an established review of injury reports and public archives. Sport-specific statistics were collected before and after shoulder arthroscopy for each athlete, providing a performance score. RTP was defined as the first game played postsurgery. Results: Of the 208 professional athletes who met the inclusion criteria, 167 (80.3%) returned to play following shoulder arthroscopy, with MLB players returning at a significantly lower rate than those of other sports (P < .0001). NBA players had significantly shorter recovery times (201 days; P < .01) and MLB players had significantly longer recovery times (413 days; P < .001) when compared with athletes in other sports. The mean number of seasons played after shoulder arthroscopy was 3.7, 4.7, 4.8, and 5.8 for MLB, NFL, NHL, and NBA, respectively. NBA players performed worse in their first season postoperative compared with their preoperative performance (P = .0017), but their postoperative season 2 performance returned to their preoperative performance level (P = .1893). Similarly, NHL players performed worse in their postoperative season 1 compared with preoperative performance (P = .0274), but their postoperative season 2 performance improved upon their preinjury performance level (P = .0861). Conclusions: There is a modest RTP rate among professional athletes following shoulder arthroscopy. MLB players have the longest average time to RTP and the shortest postinjury careers following shoulder arthroscopy. However, they demonstrate no significant decline in performance following their injury. Conversely, NBA players had the shortest average time to RTP and the longest post-injury career. Both NBA and NHL athletes experienced a decrease in performance in post-operative season one.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of six weeks of additional training with 3-against-3 (3v3) small-sided games (SSG) on the physical performance of elite nonstarter basketball players. Methods: Eleven professional basketball players (five starters and six nonstarters) performed the same training program throughout the regular season, with the only difference that after each game, the starters (S) performed low intensity shooting drills while the nonstarters (NS) performed half-court 3v3 SSG. At the start and end of the six-week period, the athletes were assessed for muscle power, speed, agility and aerobic power. Two-way analysis of variance and effect sizes were used. Mag-nitude-based inferential analyses were used to complement the parametric tests. Results: After the six weeks, the S and NS showed improvement (p<0.05) in the squat jump (S=5.8% and NS=7.1%), counter movement jump (S=3.7% and NS=3.6%), 20m-sprint (S=3.4% and NS=2.0%), agility T test (S=3.6% and NS=3.1%) and Yo-yo intermittent recovery (S=5.2% and NS=2.5%). No differences were found between groups and moments. The effect sizes showed moderate effect on agility and little effect on jumping ability, for both groups; moderate, for S, and little, for NS, on speed and aerobic conditioning. Magnitude-based inferences indicated that S were likely to outperform NS in terms of improvement in 20-m sprint ability and possibly also in agility. In regard to the other physical performance variables, the analyses of magnitude-based inferences were inconclusive. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that 3v3 SSG in the short-term on half-court, as an additional training routine for NS, can bring positive results for the physical performance for these players.

This situation was similar to PASTA rotator cuff tear. Meanwhile, there is a full-thickness radial tear in the edge. Case presentation: A 17-year-old boy twisted the left knee while playing basketball. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed radial tear of the lateral meniscus. During arthroscopy, it was found that there was a full-thickness radial tear of about 2 mm located in the edge. Partial meniscectomy was performed to treat radial meniscal tear located in the white area. After that, we found that the superior surface of the lateral meniscus was intact. However, in the inferior surface of the lateral meniscus, partial-thickness radial tear was found extending to red zone. We used FASTFIX (Smith & Nephew) for all-inside suture. As of three months after this surgery, the patient recovered smoothly. Discussion: Suspect that the force acts on a special position of meniscus and the thickness of the meniscus is uneven. Thus, it leads to partial-thickness radial tear in the inferior-surface, while the superior surface is intact. Conclusion: Partial-thickness radial tears in the inferior surface of lateral meniscus are relatively rare. This situation was similar to PASTA rotator cuff tear. Because the superior surface of the meniscus is intact, it may results in misdiagnosis. It's easy to ignore the inferior surface injury. © 2021","Arthroscopic meniscectomy; Case report; Full-thickness; Meniscal radial tear; Partial-thickness","adolescent; arthroscopic surgery; Article; basketball; case report; clinical article; conservative treatment; follow up; human; knee arthroscopy; knee meniscus rupture; knee surgery; male; meniscectomy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; palpation; pediatric physiotherapy; pediatric rehabilitation; physical examination; priority journal; range of motion; rotator cuff rupture; weight bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103708329

This performance may changes throughout the season depending on different variables related to training. The objectives of this research were to know the physical performance profiles of the players in different physical fitness tests grouped by their game position and to analyse the relationships between the results of the physical tests and the technical-tactical performance indicators obtained in competition. To do this, an elite female team was analysed and performed a centripetal force test, an anaerobic capacity test and two lower body strength tests. The results have shown that in women's basketball the players have physical fitness profiles adapted to the demands of the game. In addition, Technical-tactical performance in women's basketball is related to the physical fitness profile of the players. The 2-Point Shots Annotated (p=0.35) negatively correlated with the Explosive Distance of the anaerobic test. The 3-Point Shots Annotated correlate with the Explosive Distance of the anaerobic test (p=.007) and the Right Arch test (p=.015). Total Rebounds correlate with the Explosive Distance of the anaerobic test (p=.001) and MultiJump test Impulse (p=.036) and the Free Throws Scored with Time of the Left Arch test (p=.023). Therefore, the physical level obtained by the players in the physical fitness tests affects both the performance indicators and the final result of the competition that they obtain individually. © 2021 Revista Internacional de Ciencias del Deporte.

Seventeen players (15 male and 2 female; 25.9±9.7 yrs.) belonging to a Spanish First Division WB team volunteered. During the first in-season WB competitive week (Test), players performed 5 standardized physical tests. Tests were the 3-3-6 Test, 505 Test, Illinois Test, Repeated Sprint Ability (RSA) test and the Repeated Modified Agility T-test (rMAT). One week later (re-Test) players re-performed the tests using identical timing- and test-protocols. Change of direction ability tests' results showed high reproducibility values [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) >0.74; coefficient of variation (CV) <3.82±2.62%; standard error of the mean (SEM) <0.33]. RSA reproducibility results, both for the mean of the repetitions and for the best repetition, were also high (ICC>0.90; CV<3.85±3.59%; SEM<0.04). rMAT test results, both for the mean and the best repetition, indicated high reproducibility values as well (ICC>0.94; CV<2.18±1.73%; SEM=0.27). Results obtained for the fatigue index (Sdec) in the RSA and rMAT tests, however, indicated low reproducibility. Conclusively, all the analyzed tests showed high reproducibility values, with the exception of the Sdec index variable for the RSA and rMAT tests.

Most acute AC joint injuries surgery techniques focus on coracoclavicular (CC) ligament complex fixation; by single or double clavicle tunnel, but persisting vertical instability. In this paper, we introduce mini open triple tunnel- double flip button (TTDB) technique for acute AC joint dislocation by adding tunnel on clavicle to expand coverage of footprint of conoid and trapezoid ligament in order to improve vertical stability of the AC joint. This method is based on CC ligament augmentation with a double flip button/polydioxanone (PDS), combined with V-loop pulley suture for anatomical fixation. This is a prospective case report. Two professional, male basketball players in this study with a mean age of 25 years underwent surgery in 2019. Clinical subjective outcome, VAS score, Nottingham Clavicle Score, and radiological CC distance were measured before and after the operation. There were noticeable improvement in the patients' recovery after two years since the operation. We introduce TTDB technique as one of the open techniques for acute AC joint injuries in limited-resource hospital setting. © 2021 The Author(s)","AC joint injuries; Double button; Triple tunnel; TTDB; V-loop suture","acromioclavicular dislocation; adult; Article; basketball player; case report; clinical article; clinical outcome; human; male; Nottingham clavicle score; orthopedic surgery; prospective study; scoring system; sport injury; surgical technique; triple tunnel double flip button; visual analog scale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101784406

An easy and valid assessment tool is required to monitor the shoulder status in wheelchair athletes anytime. The present study aimed to investigate the association of wheelchair user's shoulder pain index (WUSPI) with physical examinations for tendinitis in the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) and range of motion (ROM) of shoulder movements among female wheelchair basketball players from the Japanese national team. Methods: A total of 21 female players (mean age, 32.0 ± 7.9 years) participated in this study. LHBT tendinitis was assessed using findings of tenderness in the bicipital groove point (TBGP) and speed test. Shoulder ROMs were evaluated in three movements—namely, abduction, flexion, and extension. Results: The mean total WUSPI score was 9.55 ± 13.35 points. The players were more likely to experience shoulder pain during activities related to wheelchair pushing and object lifting. A higher total WUSPI score was strongly and moderately associated with positive findings of TBGP (effect size r = 0.82) and speed test (r = 0.49), respectively. Furthermore, the total WUSPI score was significantly associated with limited ROM in shoulder abduction (r = 0.47) and flexion (r = 0.43). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the total WUSPI score had a significant area under the curve (AUC) for positive findings of TBGP (AUC = 0.98), speed test (AUC = 0.83), and limited ROM in abduction (AUC = 0.84). When optimal cut-points were set by the Youden index, total WUSPI scores of 4.1 points (sensitivity = 1.00, specificity = 0.92), 11.3 points (sensitivity = 0.80, specificity = 0.81), and 3.3 points (sensitivity = 1.00, specificity = 0.65) were recommended for screening positive findings of TBGP, speed test, and limited ROM in abduction, respectively. Conclusion: TBGP, which is a major finding of LHBT tendinitis, was strongly associated with the total WUSPI score in physical examinations. Hence, pain assessed by WUSPI could reflect the presence of LHBT tendinitis. The WUSPI is a superior tool for monitoring the shoulder status of wheelchair basketball players. © 2021","Athlete; Disability; Shoulder injury; Wheelchair sports; Wheelchair user's shoulder pain index","abduction; adult; Article; biceps brachii muscle; clinical article; clinical assessment tool; disability; disease association; female; human; Japanese (citizen); long head of the biceps tendon; movement (physiology); pain assessment; physical examination; priority journal; range of motion; receiver operating characteristic; screening; sensitivity and specificity; shoulder injury; shoulder pain; tendinitis; tendon; velocity; wheelchair athlete; wheelchair basketball; wheelchair sport; wheelchair user; Wheelchair User Shoulder Pain Index; Youden index",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100970947

Our participants were three elite shooting guards who were all Slovenian national team and Euroleague players. They were shooting from three different distances (3.75 m, 5.25 m, and 6.75 m); analysis included 90 successful shots. The kinematics of the entire body was analysed using the inertial motion capture suit. The main interest was on the transverse plane (direction Y), focusing on rotational movements and movements to the left and right. The results showed that the rotation of the shoulder axis in the transverse plane, with all three participants, was greatest (p <.05) from the longest distance. Despite that graphs of individual players differed, deviation to the left was most significant while shooting from the largest distance for all participants. Also the landing from the jump shot was on the left according to the origin. For example, the average deviation to the left for player no. 2 was 11.9 ± 3.6 cm (the shortest distance), 12.6 ± 4.7 cm (the middle distance), and 23.3 ± 5.1 cm (the longest distance). Distance from the basket influenced the kinematics of the shot, especially from the longest distance. Along with the already well-known changes in the sagittal plane (direction X and Z), this research provides information on changes in the transverse plane, which are also very important, especially while shooting from longer distances. © 2021 Nadja Podmenik, Matej Supej, Hana Debevec, Frane Erčulj, published by Sciendo 2021.","duration of the shot; position of the centre of mass and shooting hand; rotation of the shoulder axis; transverse plane","adult; article; basketball player; case report; clinical article; female; human; human experiment; kinematics; male; rotation; shoulder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106320987

Two training sessions were performed at weekly intervals before basketball training. Performance of the counter movement jump (CMJ), Abalakov jump (ABKJ), 10 m zig-zag sprint, 20 m in line sprint (measurements at 10 and 20 m), and sit and reach flexibility test (SRFT) was assessed before and after the intervention. A 4 (group) × 2 (time) repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVA) was conducted for each variable. Bonferroni post-hoc tests were used when the interaction was significant. Significant (all p < 0.05) time x group interaction was noted for SRFT, CMJ, ABK, sprint, and zig-zag 10 m, in favor of the experimental groups compared to the control group. However, improvements in physical fitness were similar between the three experimental groups. In conclusion, 7 weeks of specific plyometric, strength and COD training produced similar medium to large improvements in physical fitness of high-school basketball players. © 2021 Eduardo Sáez de Villarreal, Jose Galán Molina, Guillermo de Castro-Maqueda, José V.

The database was obtained from the official records of the players (n = 1,738), who were selected during the annual editions of the NBA Draft from 1990 to 2019. The participants' date of birth was analyzed according to the month of birth and divided into four quartiles. The place of birth was compared to the distribution of the general population' places of birth based on different communities' sizes. Chi-square analysis were used to determine if the relative age and birthplace of the players drafted differed in any systematic way from official census population distributions. Cluster analysis and standardized residuals were calculated to analyse the interaction among the contextual factors and the players' career performance. The data revealed that early-born players (Q1 and Q2) were over-represented. Moreover, players born in smaller cities (<100,000) were over-represented. The interaction analysis revealed that the players born in the bigger communities relate mainly with relatively younger players, and clusters that correspond to players born in smaller communities integrated the relatively older players. No differences were found in the players' career performance. Researchers, coaches and practitioners should be aware of the interaction between contextual factors to help nurture the development of sport talent regardless of age-related issues or communities' size.

The diagnosis is not always easy because multiple different tissues can be involved. The plantaris tendon has recently been described to frequently be involved in chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. This study aimed to evaluate possible plantaris tendon involvement in patients with chronic painful insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Methods Ninety-nine consecutive patients (74 males, 25 females) with a mean age of 40 years (range 24-64) who were surgically treated for insertional Achilles tendinopathy, were included. Clinical examination, ultrasound (US)+Doppler examination, and surgical findings were used to evaluate plantaris tendon involvement. Results In 48/99 patients, there were clinical symptoms of plantaris tendon involvement with pain and tenderness located medially at the Achilles tendon insertion. In all these cases, surgical findings showed a thick and wide plantaris tendon together with a richly vascularised fatty infiltration between the plantaris and Achilles tendon. US examination suspected plantaris involvement in 32/48 patients. Conclusion Plantaris tendon involvement can potentially be part of the pathology in chronic painful insertional Achilles tendinopathy and should be considered for diagnosis and treatment when there is distinct and focal medial pain and tenderness.

The objective of this study was to examine whether repeated jump assessments the day prior to competition (MD-1) could discriminate between fast and slow in-game performances the following day. Seven NCAA Division I Basketball athletes (4 guards and 3 forwards; 20 ± 1.2 years, 1.95 ± 0.09 m, and 94 ± 15 kg) performed a repeated-hop test on a force platform before and after each practice MD-1 to assess Reactive Strength Index (RSI) and Jump Height (JH). Peak speed was recorded during games via spatial tracking cameras. A median split analysis classified performance into FAST and SLOW relative to individual in-game peak speed. Paired T-tests were performed to assess post-to pre-practices differences. An independent sample T-test was used to assess the differences between FAST and SLOW performances. Cohen’s d effect sizes (ES) were calculated to determine the magnitude of the differences. Statistical significance was set for p ≤ 0.05. Post-practice RSI and JH were significantly higher than pre-training values prior to the FAST but not the SLOW in-game performances. A significant difference was found for MD-1 RSI when comparing FAST and SLOW conditions (p = 0.01; ES = 0.62). No significant between-group differences were obtained in JH (p = 0.07; ES = 0.45). These findings could have implications on the facilitation of reactive strength qualities in conjunction with match-play. Practitioners should evaluate the placement of stimuli to potentiate athlete readiness for competition. © 2021 by the authors.

Participants were 4th-grade students at six elementary schools in China. A total of 535 4th-grade students were assessed their soccer skills and 819 4th-grade students were assessed their basketball skills using the PE-Metric Assessment Rubrics. The results found that the soccer and basketball skill assessments had a high degree of internal consistency. And the results showed that the soccer and basketball skill assessment rubrics had a good factor structure. The students’ mean score in soccer and basketball skills assessment was lower than the Overall Competent Level. Further, the t-test indicated that soccer and basketball skill assessments had a significant difference in the mean score of Overall Competent Level between the boys and the girls. The PE-Metric Assessment Rubrics were valid and reliable assessment tools for assessing the manipulative skill competency in soccer and basketball skills among 4th-grade students in China.

This study aimed to investigate the surgical method and clinical effect of the Krackow and tendon-bundle techniques for managing acute Achilles tendon rupture. Methods: This retrospective case series study analyzed 17 cases of acute Achilles tendon rupture at the Beijing Jishuitan Hospital from December 2012 to January 2020. There were 16 men and one woman, aged 27–45 years, with an average of 39.6 years. Thirteen patients were injured while playing basketball or badminton, and 4 patients were injured while participating in a football match or other sports. All injuries were repaired using the Krackow and tendon-bundle techniques. Postoperative evaluation indicators included active range of motion during ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion, height of single foot heel lifting, Amer-Lindholm Achilles tendon function score, and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score. Results: The patients were followed-up for 6–45 months (average, 18.9 months). There was no re-rupture of the Achilles tendon, wound infection, or sural nerve injury. At the final follow-up, the affected and contralateral sides exhibited plantar flexion of 42.1 ± 4.4 ° and 43.8 ± 2.8 °, dorsiflexion of 15.8 ± 2.9 ° and 16.6 ± 2.9 °, respectively, and one foot exhibited a heel lifting height of 7.2 ± 1.0 cm and 7.5 ± 0.9 cm, respectively. There was no significant difference between the affected and contralateral sides (P>0.05). At the final follow-up, the Amer-Lindholm Achilles tendon function score was excellent in 94.1% (16/17) of the patients and good in 5.9% (1/17) of the patients. The AOFAS scores ranged from 90 to 100, with an average of 96.4 ± 3.7. Conclusion: Krackow and tendon-bundle techniques can improve the strength of the suture used for the Achilles tendon repair and ensure good matching for broken ends, and thus it is an effective repair method for closed Achilles tendon injury. © 2021 China Medical Cosmetology Press Co.

Thirty-seven players from one professional women’s team, one semi-professional women’s team, and one semi-professional men’s team wore accelerometers during training and matches throughout a competitive season. All teams were used for player role comparisons and the women’s teams were used to compare competition levels. Match and training session average intensity and volume, and durations of relative exercise intensities (inactive, light, moderate-vigorous, maximal, supramaximal) were calculated. Compared to out-rotation bench players, starters experienced twice the average match intensity and volume, spent 50% less match time being inactive, and spent 1.7–4.2× more match time in all other activity categories (p< 0.01). Compared to in-rotation bench players, starters experienced 1.2× greater average match intensity and volume, spent 17% less match time being inactive, and spent 1.4–1.5× more match time performing moderate-vigorous and maximal activity (p< 0.01). No differences in match demands were found between women’s competition levels, however the professional team experienced double the cumulative weekly training volume of the semi-professional team and spent 1.6–2.1× more cumulative weekly time in all activity categories (p< 0.01). To improve performance and reduce injury risk, players should prepare for the greatest match demands they could encounter during a season while considering potential changes to their role. Additionally, players might need their training volume managed when transitioning from a semi-professional to a professional season to reduce the injury risk from sharp increases in training demands.

Among different risk factors, a prolonged lack of vitamin D (25(OH)D) can lead to stress fractures in athletes since 25(OH)D insufficiency is associated with an increased incidence of a fracture. A 25(OH)D value of &lt;75.8 nmol/L is a risk factor for a stress fracture. 25(OH)D deficiency is, however, only one of several potential risk factors. Well-documented risk factors for a stress fracture include female sex, white ethnicity, older age, taller stature, lower aerobic fitness, prior physical inactivity, greater amounts of current physical training, thinner bones, 25(OH)D deficiency, iron deficiency, menstrual disturbances, and inadequate intake of 25(OH)D and/or calcium. Stress fractures are not uncommon in athletes and affect around 20% of all competitors. Most athletes with a stress fracture are under 25 years of age. Stress fractures can affect every sporty person, from weekend athletes to top athletes. Stress fractures are common in certain sports disciplines such as basketball, baseball, athletics, rowing, soccer, aerobics, and classical ballet. The lower extremity is increasingly affected for stress fractures with the locations of the tibia, metatarsalia and pelvis. Regarding prevention and therapy, 25(OH)D seems to play an important role. Athletes should have an evaluation of 25(OH)D-dependent calcium homeostasis based on laboratory tests of 25-OH-D3, calcium, creatinine, and parathyroid hormone. In case of a deficiency of 25(OH)D, normal blood levels of ≥30 ng/mL may be restored by optimizing the athlete’s lifestyle and, if appropriate, an oral substitution of 25(OH)D. Very recent studies suggested that the prevalence of stress fractures decreased when athletes are supplemented daily with 800 IU 25(OH)D and 2000 mg calcium.

Observational methodology was used, and an ad hoc instrument was created using Lince software. The study was conducted on a total of 7695 game actions, of which an analysis of 877 shots was made using CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) classification trees. The results obtained in this research have led us to the following conclusions: (a) the most important variable in the success of shots is to find “open shots”, regardless of the game action, (b) one-on-one actions outside and inside the zone have a clear connection to the finishes of the plays and end up in defended shots, (c) shots by ball screen lead to more open shots than in one-on-one and (d) play with passes may facilitate to find “open shots”. These results can be of interest for coaches to prepare their teams in the best possible way, but they must be interpreted with caution as the sample was very specific (Copa del Rey in the ACB League) and, therefore, it is necessary to continue investigating this topic in other competition contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

This systematic review aims to identify determinant variables in soccer, basketball and rugby using exploratory factor analysis for, training design, performance analysis and talent identification. Three electronic databases (Pub-Med, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus) were systematically searched and 34 studies were finally in-cluded in the qualitative synthesis. Through PCA, data sets were reduced by 75.07%, and 3.9 ± 2.53 factors were retained that explained 80 ± 0.14% of the total variance. All team sports should be an-alyzed or trained based on the high level of aerobic capacity combined with adequate levels of power and strength to perform repeated high-intensity actions in a very short time, which differ between team sports. Accelerations and decelerations are mainly significant in soccer, jumps and landings are crucial in basketball, and impacts are primarily identified in rugby. Besides, from these team sports, primary information about different technical/tactical variables was extracted such as (a) soccer: occupied space, ball controls, passes, and shots; (b) basketball: throws, rebounds, and turnovers; or (c) rugby: possession game pace and team formation. Regarding talent identification, both anthropometrics and some physical capacity measures are relevant in soccer and basketball. Although overall, since these variables have been identified in different investigations, further studies should perform PCA on data sets that involve variables from different dimensions (technical, tactical, conditional). © 2021 by the authors.

The assessment of such skills is particularly challenging in complex team sports. To address this challenge, this study aimed to conceptualize a reliable and valid video-based decision-making assessment in youth basketball. The study sample comprised youth basketball players of the German U16 national team (n = 17; MAge = 16.01 ± 0.25 years) and students of a sports class (n = 17; MAge = 15.73 ± 0.35 years). Diagnostic validity was tested by determination of the performance levels according to response accuracy as well as response time in the assessment. External validity was examined by investigation of the correlation between the diagnostic results of the elite athletes and their real game performance data associated with passing skills. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the diagnostic results discriminate between performance levels (χ2 (2) = 20.39, p &lt; 0.001, Nagelkerke’s R2 = 0.60). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a positive relationship between the diagnostic results and assists (F(2,10) = 4.82, p &lt; 0.05; R2 = 0.49) as well as turnovers per game (F(2,10) = 5.23, p &lt; 0.05; R2 = 0.51). However, no relationship was detected regarding the assist-turnover ratio. Further, response time discriminated within the elite athletes’ performance data but not between performance levels while for response accuracy the opposite is the case. The results confirm the diagnostic and external validity of the assessment and indicate its applicability to investigate decision-making skills in youth basketball. © 2021, MDPI AG.

However, low level of adoption of these programs remains a problem. Understanding the current warm-ups in youth basketball and coaches' perceptions on injury prevention can guide the design of superior implementation strategies. This study describes warm-ups in youth basketball and coaches' injury prevention-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and information sources. Methods: Youth basketball coaches (n = 50) completed a preseason questionnaire. The questionnaire covered warm-up length, use of aerobic/agility/balance/strength/other exercises in the warm-up, injury-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and sources of information. Results: Typical warm-up duration was ≤ 10 min (48.0% of coaches, 95% CI: ±13.8%). All coaches included aerobic exercises in their warm-up. Agility, strength, and balance exercises were utilized by 80.0% (95% CI: ±11.7%), 70.7% (95% CI: ±13.6%), and 26.8% (95% CI: ±13.6%) of coaches, respectively. Most coaches agreed to some extent that basketball injuries are preventable (94%) and that participating in a NMT warm-up program would reduce player's risk of injury (92%). Other coaches were identified as the most common source of information on warm-ups and injury prevention. Discussion: Coaches use parts of effective NMT warm-up programs, but balance exercises are not well adopted. Considering the level of evidence supporting the importance of balance exercises in injury prevention, it is crucial to improve the implementation of NMT warm-up programs in youth basketball, for example, through educational courses. As fellow coaches were identified as the most important source of information, coaches' role in knowledge translation should be emphasized.

The patterns of injuries and illnesses that occurred among Korean athletes during the 2018 Asian Games held in Indonesia were studied. Methods We recorded the occurrence of all injuries and illnesses reported to the chief medical officer, coordinated with the help of an instant social messaging application in real time. Results A total of 782 elite athletes participated in 46 sporting events. A total of 141 (18.03%) injuries were recorded, with 121 (15.47%) athletes suffering at least one injury. Out of 141 injuries 80 (56.74%) were in male athletes and 61 (43.26%) were in female athletes. The highest number of injuries was seen among sport climbing athletes (n=10, 71.43%), followed by sepak takraw. A total of 16 (11.35%) injuries were expected to prevent athletes from participation in competition/training. Most of the injuries occurred during training (46.10%), with lower lumbar spine being the most common part injured. A total of 209 (26.72%) illnesses were reported, with at least one illness in 170 (21.73%) athletes. The incidence among female athletes (26.90%) was comparable with that of male athletes (26.90%). Maximum illness rate was reported in table tennis (100%). The most common system involved was gastrointestinal (n=93, 44.49%), followed by respiratory (n=53, 25.36%). Environmental factors were causative in 111 athletes (53.11%) and infection in 79 (37.79%). Illnesses resulted in loss of at least 1 day among 30 (14.35%) athletes. Conclusion Overall 15.47% of athletes suffered at least one injury and 21.73% suffered at least one illness; the incidence of injury and illness varied depending on the type of sports. ©","athlete; illness; injuries; olympics","abdominal pain; adult; ankle sprain; arthritis; Article; athletics; badminton; baseball; basketball; bowling; boxing; bursitis; climbing (sport); cohort analysis; concussion; coughing; cycling; diarrhea; diving; dyspnea; elite athlete; environmental factor; equestrian; female; fencing (sport); fever; football; gastrointestinal symptom; golf; gymnastics; hand ball; hockey; human; incidence; infection; injury severity; jiu jitsu; joint dislocation; judo; kabaddi; karate; knee ligament injury; kurash; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; medical personnel; modern pentathlon; muscle strain; musculoskeletal disease; neurologic disease; pain; paragliding; physical disease; physician; priority journal; prospective study; roller sport; rowing; rugby; sailing (water sport); sepak takraw; shooting (sport); skiing; soft tennis; softball; South Korean; spine injury; sport; sport injury; sporting event; squash (sport); subluxation; swimming; synovitis; taekwondo; tendon rupture; tennis; tooth injury; training; triathlon; volleyball; vomiting; water polo; weight lifting; wrestling; wushu (sport)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100717888

A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted. Thirty-two male and female basketball players with CAI were randomly assigned to receive either DN (n = 16) or placebo DN (n = 16). Pre-activation amplitudes of PL and TA were assessed with surface electromyography (EMG) during a dynamic landing test. Center of pressure (CoP) displacement and sway variability in anterior-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions were measured with a force platform during a single leg balance test (SLBT). Measures were obtained prior to a single DN intervention, immediately after, at 48 h, and 1 month after. The DN group displayed a significant increase in PL and TA pre-activation values, which were maintained 1 month later. Significant reductions in the ML and AP displacements and sway variability of CoP were found for the DN group.

A total of 23 basketball and 25 handball players performed a test battery consisting of functional movements and a jump test. Inter-limb asymmetry was calculated using a standard percentage difference equation. A between-groups comparison analysis was carried out, and Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to establish a relationship between asymmetries and physical performance. The results found athletes in different sports to exhibit different performance in functional movements and the jump test, but no bilateral asymmetries. The reactive strength index (RSI) and stiffness asymmetries were significantly associated with the anterior reach Y-balance test (YBT) (r = −0.412; p < 0.01 and r = −0.359; p < 0.05, respectively), and the unilateral triple hop test (THTU) was negatively correlated to anterior reach, posterior lateral reach YBT and YBT composite YBT (r = −0.341 to −0.377; p < 0.05). These findings suggest that the asymmetries exhibited important dispersion not dependent upon the type of sport but on each individual and the applied test. In addition, asymmetry in anterior direction YBT showed the strongest association to the rest of the sports performance variables. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: Team physicians for professional sports teams in the National Football League, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, and National Basketball Association were identified and characterized based on training background, practice setting, and geographic location. Rates of social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and ResearchGate were determined. Differences between social media users and nonusers were analyzed. Results: In total, 505 professional team physicians were identified across 4 major professional sports; 64.6% of physicians were orthopaedic surgeons. Of 505 physicians, 65.7% had a social media presence. More specifically, 21.8% had a professional Facebook page, 22.6% a professional Twitter page, 52.1% a LinkedIn profile, 21.4% a ResearchGate profile, and 9.1% an Instagram account. Fellowship-trained physicians (P =.008) had greater odds of having a social media presence. Conclusions: Nearly two-thirds of professional team physicians have a social media presence, most commonly LinkedIn.

Methods: Concussion data for NBA players were collected from the 1999-2000 to 2017-2018 seasons, from publicly available sources. Age, position, injury, time to RTP, and demographic factors were collected. The 90-day period after each case of concussion was reviewed for acute noncontact LE musculoskeletal injury. Control athletes without a documented history of concussion were matched to concussed athletes by age, body mass index, position, and experience. Conditional logistic regression with a calculated odds ratio and a 95% confidence interval were used to assess the association between concussion and subsequent risk of LE injury. Results: In total, 189 concussions were documented in 153 athletes. Of these, 140 cases were the first recorded instance of concussion in players with publicly available data. Thirty-six (25.7%) athletes sustained a LE injury within 90 days of concussion; 26 (20.2%) were non–season-ending and included in RTP analysis. The odds of sustaining an acute LE musculoskeletal injury within the 90-day period after concussion was 4.69 times greater in concussed players compared with controls (95% confidence interval 1.96-11.23, P <.001). There was no significant difference in games (4.2 ± 5.0 vs 4.7 ± 4.7 games, P =.566) or days (18.5 ± 39.1 days vs 10.9 ± 10.6 days, P =.912) missed between concussed players with LE injury and nonconcussed controls. The most common LE injuries in concussed athletes were ligament sprains/tears (65%). Conclusions: Concussed NBA athletes have increased odds for sustaining an acute LE musculoskeletal injury within 90 days of RTP compared with nonconcussed controls. The most common injuries were ligament strains or tears. Changes in neuromotor control and proprioception following a concussion should be evaluated in high-level basketball players returning to sport.

The first sub-sample consisted of 12 players of WBC Celje (average age 21.75±2.70), while the other sub-sample consisted of 14 players of WBC Buducnost Bemax (average age of 20.71±3.15). All players were tested in Podgorica, Montenegro. Anthropometric characteristics and body composition were evaluated using a battery of eleven variables: body height (cm), body weight (kg), triceps skinfold, back skinfold, biceps skinfold, abdominal skinfold, thighs skinfold, calf skinfold, body mass index (BMI), percentage of fat and muscle mass (kg). Differences in anthropometric characteristic and composition of the body of the female basketball players of two clubs were determined by using a discriminatory parametric procedure with t-test for small independent samples (p<0.05). It was found that the basketball players of Celje are slightly higher and have more body mass than the players of Buducnost Bemax. Also, there are significant statistical differences by two variables that estimate the calf skinfold and thigh skinfold, in favour of the Celje, but WBC Buducnost Bemax had better fat percentage value.

The purpose of our research is to effect studies related to the effectiveness of shooting the basket in women basketball for various age groups: U16, U18, and U20. For the research, we have studied specialized literature and analysed game effectiveness statistic data from the Genius Sport official system for registering the game indicators of the European Basketball Federation (FIBA). The initial data are processed mathematically-statistically by variation analysis, relative share for establishing the effectiveness of shooting baskets from various distances, and comparative analysis. We have researched shooting effectiveness data from the last European championships for the three age groups. The results show a decrease in the competitors’ skills for effecting baskets by the growth of age. We can conclude that women’s basketball is a dynamic sport with many elements, but the effectiveness of shooting baskets is at its core, which is something that is often forgotten. Coaches working at each level should use at least 30% of the training and training process for specific shooting exercises for the basket; this is the minimum that can stop this process so that the game of basketball does not go into an existential crisis. © 2021 Montenegrin Sports Academy.

Thirty-six well trained junior basketball players (n = 36; 17.58 ± 0.50 years) were recruited and randomly allocated into: Flywheel group (FST; n = 12), traditional strength training group (TST; n = 12) and control group (CON; n = 12). All groups attended 5 basketball practices and one official match a week during the study period. Experimental groups additionally participated in the eight-week, 1–2 d/w equivolume intervention conducted using a flywheel device (inertia = 0.075 kg·m−2) for FST or free weights (80%1 RM) for TST. Pre-to post changes in lower limb isometric strength (ISOMET), 5 and 20 m sprint time (SPR5m and SPR20m), countermovement jump height (CMJ) and change of direction ability (t-test) were assessed with analyses of variance (3 × 2 ANOVA). Significant group-by-time interaction was found for ISOMET (F = 6.40; p = 0.000), cmJ (F = 7.45; p = 0.001), SPR5m (F = 7.45; p = 0.010) and T test (F = 10.46; p = 0.000). The results showed a significantly higher improvement in cmJ (p = 0.006; 11.7% vs. 6.8%), SPR5m (p = 0.001; 10.3% vs. 5.9%) and t-test (p = 0.045; 2.4% vs. 1.5%) for FST compared to the TST group. Simultaneously, th FST group had higher improvement in ISOMET (p = 0.014; 18.7% vs. 2.9%), cmJ (p = 0.000; 11.7% vs. 0.3%), SPR5m (p = 0.000; 10.3% vs. 3.4%) and t-test (p = 0.000; 2.4% vs. 0.6%) compared to the CON group. Players from the TST group showed better results in cmJ (p = 0.006; 6.8% vs. 0.3%) and t-test (p = 0.018; 1.5% vs. 0.6%) compared to players from the CON group. No significant group-by-time interaction was found for sprint 20 m (F = 2.52; p = 0.088). Eight weeks of flywheel training (1–2 sessions per week) performed at maximum concentric intensity induces superior improvements in cmJ, 5 m sprint time and change of direction ability than equivolumed traditional weight training in well trained junior basketball players. Accordingly, coaches and trainers could be advised to use flywheel training for developing power related performance attributes in young basketball players. © 2021 by the authors.

Dribbling and passing skills were assessed during four games of U19 female basketball players and five games of senior (2nd division) female basketball players. In total, 551 dribbling and 914 passing executions were evaluated. Binary logistic regression identified defensive pressure of the opponent as a predictor of dribbling and passing skills effectivity. When the defensive pressure of the opponent was medium, the chances for the ineffective pass were 1.997 times more likely (95% CI; 1.179–3.383), as it is at the minimum defensive pressure. When the defensive pressure of the opponent was high, the chances for ineffective dribbling were 7.45 times more likely (95% CI; 3.672–15.113) and for ineffective pass were 8.419 times more likely (95% CI; 4.6–15.409), as it is at minimum defensive pressure. The game quarter and the internal load were not identified as the predictors influencing the dribbling and passing effectivity. Possession duration was also an insignificant predictor of dribbling and passing skills effectivity. However, the passing skill effectivity decreases when the shot clock is winding down. These findings confirm the importance of transferring game situations into the training process. Coaches should take into account these factors when they want to stimulate determinants of player performance in a balanced and systematic way. © 2021 by the authors.

Winning or losing a game mostly depends on the shooting effectiveness. The study aims to compare the selected kinematic variables of 2-point (2-pt) and 3-point (3-pt) jump shots (after making a cut and receiving the ball) and ascertain the differences between elite male under 16 and 18 (U16M, U18M) and female under 16 and 18 (U16F, U18F) basketball players. Overall, forty-eight young male and female basketball players participated in the study. 3D motion analysis using an inertial suit with the addition of utilizing a smart ball was performed for assessing the 2-pt and 3-pt shooting techniques. Players in male categories shot for 2-pt with a higher center of mass difference in the vertical direction (U16M 5.7 cm, U18M 3.9 cm vs. U16F 1.4 cm, U18F 0.6 cm), with higher release shoulder angle (U16M 110.9, U18M 113.8 vs. U16F 103, U18F 105), and with a higher entry angle of the ball (U16M 34, U18M 32 vs. U16F 30, U18F 30) when compared to female categories (p < 0.001). In the 3-pt shooting, there were differences between male and female categories in the shoulder angle when releasing the ball (p < 0.001). In the players shooting speed, there were differences between U16M vs. U18F (0.95 ± 0.1 vs. 0.88 ± 0.1; p = 0.03) and U16F vs. U18F (0.96 ± 0.06 vs. 0.88 ± 0.1; p = 0.02) players. Male categories shot 3-pt shots with a smaller center of mass difference in the horizontal direction when compared to 2-pt shots (p < 0.001). The entry angle was higher in successful shooting attempts compared to unsuccessful shooting attempts when shooting for 3-pt (p = 0.02). Player shooting speed was higher in all categories (except U18F) when shooting for 3-pt (p < 0.001). It appears that performers show difference in kinematic variables based on distance from the basket. Basketball coaches and players should work to minimize the kinematic differences between 2-pt and 3-pt shooting and to optimize the shooting technique. © 2021 by the authors.

Basketball entails specific types of movements, physiological requirements and energy sources. The duration of physiological responses involving ATP, CP and glycolysis responses to this type of activity is 5-6 seconds for a single sprint, and a contribution of the aerobic system is of less than 10%. Recovery periods in basketball, as a rule, are not long enough to fill the gap for such high intensity activities. It is hard to achieve the same level of performance consistently over time in repeated sprints. This means that basketball players need great athletic ability in order to demonstrate speed, strength and power required to produce a successful performance most proficiently. Therefore, tests are needed to help coaches to monitor their players and ensure that they have the physiological capacity required for the game. The aim of fitness tests is to assess the condition of athletes in terms of each fitness component, in order to determine what needs to be improved through the training program and to conduct retests at set times to assess whether their condition has changed. The literature offers a number of widely used tests to measure aerobic and anaerobic fitness. This article reviews the physiological demands of basketball and analyzes the field tests commonly used at present. The article emphasizes the need for a specific test that will serve coaches and physical fitness trainers in monitoring their players. © 2021 Roni Gottlieb, Asaf Shalom, Julio Calleja-Gonzalez, published by Sciendo 2021.","aerobic; anaerobic; explosive",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101286735

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of RSA with one vs. five changes of direction (IRSA5COD) on squat jump (SJ), five jump test (FJT) and three point shot (3PS) performances in male basketball players. Sixteen participants (23.4 ± 2.3 years; 1.86 ± 0.10 m; 77.8 ± 7.7 kg) randomly performed eight testing sessions consisting of either RSA (10 repetitions of (15 m + 15 m)) or IRSA5COD (10 repetitions of (5 m + 5 m + 5 m + 5 m + 5 m + 5 m)) performed alone or immediately followed by the SJ, FJT or 3PS. The heart rate (HR) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were continuously recorded, while blood lactate concentration was measured post-tests. Differences between RSA and IRSA5COD were evaluated by a Student t-test for paired samples, while analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with repeated measures assessed differences in SJ, FJT and 3PS performance between baseline, post-RSA and post-IRSA5COD. A significantly poorer FJT performance post-RSA was shown compared to baseline (7.47 ± 0.47 vs.7.54 ± 0.47 m, p = 0.01) and post-IRSA5COD (7.47 ± 0.47 vs. 7.56 ± 0.49%, p = 0.048). Significantly lower 3PS accuracy was also observed post-IRSA5COD compared to baseline (41.3 ± 3.1 vs.53.1 ± 2.8%, p = 0.003) and post-RSA (41.3 ± 3.1 vs. 48.1 ± 3.7%, p = 0.033). These results suggest that jump performance required for crucial actions such as lay-ups is negatively affected by longer sprints (15-m) with few changes of direction, while 3PS accuracy is impaired by shorter sprints with many changes of direction. These situations should be replicated when training these particular abilities to optimize training adaptations. © 2021 Seifeddine Brini, Anne Delextrat, Anissa Bouassida, published by Sciendo 2021.","coordination; fatigue; jumping; neuromuscular; performance; team sport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101254958

Twenty-seven elite female basketball players (aged 21.0 ± 2.6 years) were assigned between an experimental group (n = 15) who substituted a part of their usual training with biweekly PT, and a control group (n = 12) who maintained their standard basketball training. Analyses of variance and co-variance assessed changes in 10, 20, and 30 m sprint times, ability to change direction (T-test) and jumping ability [squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ)] with electromyographic assessment of the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and rectus femoris muscles during jumping and meassurement of the isokinetic strength of the knee muscles. After 8 weeks of the plyometric program the experimental group enhanced change of direction performance (Δ = −3.90%, d = 0.67) and showed a greater thigh cross sectional area (Δ = 9.89%, d = 0.95) relative to controls. Neural adaptations included significant improvements of EMG parameters for the vastus medialis muscle during Squat Jumping (Δ = 109.3%, d = 0.59). However, trends to improvements of sprinting times and jumping performances did not reach statistical significance. In addition, there were no gains in the peak torque and the average power of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles at either slow or moderate test speeds. We conclude that 8-weeks of PT (72–126 jumps) was insufficient to improve many of the variables associated with basketball performance in our subject-group. Further studies of female basketball players, extending the program period and increasing the intensity and speed of jumps are recommended in the search for more significant results. © Copyright © 2021 Cherni, Hammami, Jelid, Aloui, Suzuki, Shephard and Chelly.","ability to change direction; electromyographic activity; peak power; peak torque; vertical jumping","adult; analysis of variance; article; basketball player; clinical article; controlled study; covariance; female; hamstring muscle; human; jumping; knee; muscle training; physical performance; plyometrics; rectus femoris muscle; season; statistical significance; substitution reaction; torque; vastus lateralis muscle; vastus medialis muscle; velocity; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100519866

Injury data underpins the design and evaluation of injury prevention strategies in elite sport. The aim of this study was to investigate frequency, characteristics and management of lumbosacral injuries in elite athletes with limb deficiency. Methods A retrospective analysis of injuries in elite athletes with limb deficiency (2008 to 2017) was conducted using available data extracted from The English Institute of Sport (EIS) clinical records. Eligibility criteria: funded athletes, eligible for EIS physiotherapy support with full or partial limb deficiency. Data were analysed descriptively using frequencies. Results A total of 107 injuries from 32 athletes were included. Participants comprised 18 men (59%), from 9 sports, with mean age for index injuries of 27 years (range 18 to 38 years) and 15 with congenital limb deficiency (47%). Average number of index injuries for congenital and traumatic limb deficient groups were 13 and 19, respectively. Where injury onset was recorded (n=79), half of injuries occurred during training (40%, n=43). Arthrogenic structures accounted for 32.7% of injuries, myogenic 26.2%, with neurogenic, discogenic and osteogenic each <5%. The number of treatments delivered in each injury episode ranged from 1 to 43, with symptom resolution taking 2 to 439 days. Conclusion Elite athletes with limb deficiency experience lumbosacral injuries predominantly involving muscles and joints. While consistency and accuracy of data recording limits definitive conclusions, findings highlight the importance of precision in recording injury data as part of surveillance to enable implementation of effective injury prevention strategies. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 1-min RW at high-intensity on the performance and physiological responses during the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test (LIST). In a randomized and counterbalanced cross-over design, 12 male amateur intermittent team sports players (soccer, basketball, handball, and lacrosse; age, 22 ± 2 years; height, 1.70 ± 0.08 m; body mass, 65.1 ± 8.3 kg; body mass index, 22.4 ± 1.9 kg m−2; VO2max, 53.5 ± 4.5 ml kg−1 min−1) performed the LIST. The LIST comprised two 45-min halves separated by a 15-min HT. Each half comprised repetitions of exercise cycles consisting of 3 × 20-m walking, 1 × 20-m maximal sprint, 3 × 20-m jogging, and 3 × 20-m running. During the HT, the participants were assigned to a control trial (CON; 15-min seated rest) or an RW trial (1-min running at 90% of the maximal oxygen uptake after a 14-min seated rest). Compared to the CON, the RW prevents reductions in sprint performance at the fourth and sixth periods of the LIST (fourth: 2.4%, p = 0.002, d = 1.68, sixth: 3.6%, p = 0.012, d = 1.74) and a decrement of gastrointestinal temperature during HT (0.5°C, p = 0.010, d = 1.41). Moreover, the RW decreased the electromyogram amplitude of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) after HT (12%, p = 0.017, d = 1.12) without a decrease of maximal voluntary contraction force, suggesting an increased neuromuscular efficiency (9%, p = 0.048, d = 0.58). The RW also increased the mean heart rate in the initial part of the second half (4 bpm, p = 0.016, d = 0.38). In conclusion, the RW improved sprint performance, core temperature, muscle activation, and heart rate in the second half of the LIST. The findings suggest that the RW should be recommended for intermittent team sports players when longer RWs are not possible. © Copyright © 2021 Yanaoka, Iwata, Yoshimura and Hirose.","gastrointestinal temperature; half-time; heart rate; intermittent team sports; muscle activation","adult; article; basketball; body mass; controlled study; core temperature; electromyogram; heart rate; human; human experiment; jogging; male; maximal oxygen uptake; muscle contraction; randomized controlled trial; running; soccer; team sport; walking; warm up; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100064892

We examine the timing, intensity and sequence of muscular strength according to biological age (years from peak height velocity (PHV)) and hypothesize that young basketball players attain their peak muscular strength spurts around PHV. A total of 160 adolescent male basketballers, aged 11–15 years, were followed bi-annually over 3 consecutive years. The years from attainment of PHV and peak weight velocity (PWV) were estimated and five muscular strength measures (sit-ups, handgrip, seated medicine ball throw, squat jump and countermovement jump) were aligned to years from PHV in 3-month intervals. Strength velocities were estimated using a non-smooth mathematical model. The mean ages at-PHV and at-PWV were 13.90 ± 1.40 years and 13.90 ± 1.79 years, respectively. Maximal velocity in sit-ups was attained 6 months prior to attainment of PHV (intensity = 10.69 repetitions·year−1), whereas maximal velocity in squat jump occurred 6 months after-PHV (intensity = 3.93 cm·year−1). Handgrip strength, seated medicine ball throw and countermovement jump maximal velocity peaked at-PHV (intensity = 8.47 kgf·year−1, intensity = 0.75 m·year−1, intensity = 5.59 cm·year−1, respectively). In general, maximal velocity spurts did not differ in their timing, with the velocities reaching a peak concurrent with PHV and PWV or within 6 months of its attainment. Basketball coaches, as well as strength and conditioning trainers, should consider individual differences in strength development and be aware of rapid periods of growth in stature when planning and designing muscular strength training regimes. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there are just a few studies featuring a kinematic analysis of passing. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the kinematic parameters and accuracy of passing changed when players were under the influence of fatigue. Eleven Croatian basketball players who are members of the youth national program (age: 18.36 ± 0.67 years; height: 192.32 ± 9.98 cm; weight: 83.35 ± 11.19 kg; body fat: 15.00 ± 4.40%, arm span: 194.34 ± 10.39 cm) participated in fatigue and non-fatigue repetitive tests. A Xsens suit was used to analyze the kinematic parameters of push passing; a radar gun was used to determine ball speed; heart rate and blood lactate were used to identify fatigue and non-fatigue state. There was a significant difference in angular velocities of shoulder (p = 0.01), elbow (p = 0.04), and wrist (p = 0.01), accuracy (p = 0.01), ball speed (p = 0.00), pelvis position (p = 0.00), and velocity of the pelvis in X-axis (p = 0.00) between fatigue and non-fatigue state. Fatigue influences some kinematic parameters and accuracy of passing.

The data from the 1985 National Children and Youth Fitness Study (NCYFS) and the 2012 NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey (NNYFS) were matched, merged (N = 6178, 3107 boys and 3071 girls), and analyzed. It was found that basketball remained the most popular PA inside school PE across both surveys. Swimming was the most popular PA outside of school PE in 1985, but was replaced by running in 2012. Although PA taught and promoted inside of school PE and that such PA practiced outside were moderately correlated across the surveys, some disconnections were noticed. The impact of grade, sex, and weight status on PA preference and participation was also confirmed.

The assessment of physical fitness is the most reliable method for knowing if the athlete’s physical fitness is appropriate. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to identify profiles of physical-physiological demands with different specific tests of physical fitness related to the maximum strength of the lower body and speed. Moreover, some differences based on the sex and age of the players were identified. One hundred and forty-nine basketball players were analyzed (men n = 103 vs. women n = 46, weight: 74.74 ± 11.65 kg vs. 56.89 ± 3.71 kg, height: 184.66 ± 11.67 vs. 164 ± 4 and BMI: 21.7 ± 0.83 vs. 21.6 ± 0.90). The players performed an Abalakov test, a multi-jump test, and a repeat sprint ability test. Each player was equipped with a WIMU PRO device, and photoelectric cells were used. A MANOVA was performed to discover the differences between ages, and a t-test was used regarding sex. The results showed significant differences based on age and sex in variables related to time and Player Load/min (p < 0.001). The variables related to steps (contact, step, flight) also showed significant differences as a function of age (p < 0.001) and sex (p < 0.05). The multi-jump test showed differences based on age (p < 0.05 except in between jumps), but not on sex. These results confirm the importance of working together on lower body strength and speed skills. In addition, the planning of the work on these abilities must be individualized and according to the characteristics of the athlete. © 2021 by the authors.

There is currently no overview of the incidence, the risk factors and preventive measures of musculoskeletal injuries among youth basketball players. Objective: This systematic review describes the most common injuries among youth basketball players. The most common risk factors and various preventive measures and interventions have also been reported and discussed. Methods: Search strategies were built based on groups of keywords, namely 'injury', 'youth basketball', and 'cohort'. Search strategies were entered into Medline and SPORTDiscus. Titles, abstracts and full text articles were screened by two researchers. Data from the included articles were extracted by one researcher and checked by another researcher. Results: Twenty-seven studies showed that the overall injury rate ranged from 2.64 to 3.83 per 1 000 hours of exposure. Ankle-(22%-37%) and knee injuries (5%-41%) were the most common injuries. Risk factors for knee injuries included ankle dorsiflexion with a range less than 36.5 degrees and female athletes with greater hip abduction strength. High variations of postural sway corresponded to occurrences of ankle injuries (p=0.01, OR =1.22; p<0.001, OR =1.22). A core intervention (rate = 4.99/1 000 athlete exposure (AEs)) focused on the trunk and lower extremity led to a reduction in injuries compared to a sham intervention (rate =7.72/1 000 AEs) (p=0.02). Wearing a McDavid Ultralight 195 brace reduced ankle injuries compared to the controls (HR 0.30; 95 % CI 0.17 0.90; p=0.03). Conclusion: Ankle and knee injuries are the most common injuries among youth basketball players. Poor postural control, reduced ankle dorsiflexion and high hip abduction strength are the main risk factors. A neuromuscular warm-up, in combination with strength and stability exercises, seems to be the best training method to prevent injuries. Ankle injuries can be reduced by wearing a lace-up ankle brace. © 2021 The Author(s).","Basketball; Injury; Preventive Intervention; Risk Factor",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85149848605

All athletes (minors and adults) who provided consent, or consent given from the minors' guardians, were included in this study. Athletes who did not provide consent for this study were excluded. Results: Athletes (n = 1 521; 531 women and 990 men) reported 160 injuries (injury incidence rate of 11%) and 85 illnesses (illness incidence rate of 6%). The percentage of distribution of injuries were highest in football and basketball. Most injuries occurred during competition, compared with training, joint sprains were the most common type of injury (28%), followed by muscle strains (19%). Men suffered most of the injuries (79% vs. 21% for women). Similarly, men sustained more illnesses than women (57% vs. 43%). Most illnesses affected the respiratory system (67%), and infection was the most common cause of illness (84%) in participating athletes. Conclusion: These findings are similar to previous events in other parts of the world. However, unique ailments, not previously reported on, were discovered. Epidemiological data from this study can be inferred to athletes who compete in similar multi-sport events in the Indian Ocean region. © 2021 Authors.

The keywords mental toughness and performance/outcomes/results/ competition were used to identify the papers. The search included the EBSCO and PubMed databases. Eventually, the analysis covered 18 articles. The research results presented in 16 papers confirmed the positive correlations of mental toughness with sport results and performance level. No such relationship was found only in equestrian and Alpine skiing athletes. Although mental toughness in basketball players did not correlate with the sport results, it was an important predictor. Higher mental toughness was found in athletes with better sports results, and it was a positive correlate or predictor of sports results. The relationships between mental toughness and competitive experience or age were not statistically significant. Various research tools were used to measure mental toughness: PPI, PPI-A, SMTQ, MTQ48, MTI, SMTI, MeBTough. The results confirm the positive correlation between mental toughness and sport results or performance levels in different sports, regardless of gender, age or level of sports skills. It seems appropriate to continue research on mental toughness in sport, including the relationship between mental toughness and sporting performance, differences between men and women, players in individual and team sports, the relationship between mental toughness and training experience, the athletes’ age, and the effectiveness of mental toughness programs. © Gdansk University of Physical Education and Sport, Poland.","mental toughness; sports performance; sports result",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147867531

This study investigated whether static balance and knee proprioception in deaf basketball players are different from those in individuals with normal hearing. Material and methods: ‪12 deaf national basketball players and 13 individuals with normal hearing were included. Static balance was evaluated using the Biodex-BioSway Balance System. Knee proprioception was assessed using a Dualer IQ Digital Inclinometer with the active angle repetition test. ‪Results: The dominant-side mediolateral stability index and non-dominant-side overall, anteroposterior, and mediolateral stability index scores of deaf basketball players in the postural stability test were different compared with those of the individuals with normal hearing (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of knee proprioception (p>0.05). ‪Conclusions: Although there was no difference in knee proprioception in deaf basketball players, it is noteworthy that their postural stability was more impaired compared with that in individuals with normal hearing. Despite regular exercise, deaf basketball players had poorer balance than individuals with normal hearing. Therefore, balance and vestibular exercises should be added to the training programs of these athletes. © Gdansk University of Physical Education and Sport, Poland.","deaf basketball; hearing impairment; postural stability; proprioception; static balance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129764820

Prior authors have examined the value of the LESS in identifying ACL injury risk in athletic populations. Yet, no study has evaluated the association between LESS performance and incidence of any type of lower extremity injury in female collegiate athletes across multiple sports. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the association between LESS performance as measured with a markerless motion-capture system and lower extremity injury in female collegiate athletes. Study Design Prospective cohort study. Methods One hundred and ten DI female collegiate athletes (basketball, n=12; field hockey, n=17; gymnastics, n=14; lacrosse, n=27; softball, n=23; volleyball, n=17) completed a jump-landing test prior to the start of their sport seasons. The LESS was automatically scored using a Microsoft Kinect sensor and Athletic Movement Assessment software (PhysiMax®). Participants were tracked throughout one competitive season for incidence of time-loss lower extremity injury. A Receiver Operating Characteristic curve determined the optimal cutpoint for the total LESS score for predicting injury. Pearson’s Chi squared statistics examined the association between injury and LESS total scores >5. The Fisher exact test evaluated group differences for the frequency of receiving an error on individual LESS test items. Results Female collegiate athletes with LESS scores >5 were not more likely to be injured than those with scores ≤5 (χ2=2.53, p=0.111). The relative risk of injury to this group was 1.78 (95% CI=0.86, 3.68) while the odds ratio was 2.10 (95% CI=0.83, 5.27). The uninjured group was more likely to receive an error on lateral trunk flexion at initial contact than the injured group (p=0.023). Conclusion The LESS total score was not associated with an increased odds of lower extremity injury. © 2021, North American Sports Medicine Institute.

The task oriented motivational climate created by a coach was defined as the social factor, whereas the satisfaction of need for competence and enjoyment were the psychological mediators of amotivation. Cognitive outcome was defined as the intention to drop out of sports. The sample consisted of 383 respondents, 49.9% boys and 50.1% girls from Serbia, average age 13.74 years, who actively played volleyball, basketball, and handball. Results of the structural modelling equation analysis confirmed that the HMIEM represented a good model for understanding the process of dropping out, and that it explained 18.9% of the intention to drop out of sports in adolescence. Athletes who perceive their coach’s behaviour as non-supportive, rigid, primarily focused on achievement, will have sense of incompetence and will lack enjoyment while doing sport. Unsatisfied needs then lead to the development of amotivation – the lack of reasons to do sports, and to the intention to drop out of sports. These results represent a further step towards creating educational programmes for youth sport that might prevent dropping out of sport in adolescence. © 2021, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Kinesiology.

TSD may be apparent during certain tasks such as writing, playing musical instruments, or other activities requiring fine motor control, but may also occur during certain sports, and maybe detrimental to professional athletes’ careers. Therefore, sports physicians and movement disorder neurologists need to be aware of the presentation and phenomenology of sports-related dystonia (SRD), the topic of this review. Methods: A broad PubMed search using a wide range of keywords and combinations was done in October 2021 to identify suitable articles for this review. Results: Most of the publications are on yips in golfers and on runners’ dystonia. Other sports in which SRD has been reported are ice skating, tennis, table tennis, pistol shooting, petanque, baseball, and billiards. Discussion: Yips, which may affect up to half of the golfers and rarely athletes in other sports (e.g., baseball, cricket, basketball, speed skating, gymnastics) seems to be a multifactorial form of TSD that is particularly troublesome in highly skilled professional golfers. Runners’ dystonia, affecting the foot, leg, and hip (in decreasing order), may evolve into more generalized and less specific dystonia. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of SRD are not well understood. Botulinum toxin has been reported to alleviate dystonia in golfers’, runners’, and other forms of SRD. Future studies should utilize neurophysiologic, imaging, and other techniques to elucidate mechanisms of this underrecognized group of movement disorders. © 2021 The Author(s).","Dystonia; sports; task-specific; yips","botulinum toxin; trihexyphenidyl; acupuncture; ankle sprain; athlete; auditory stimulation; baseball; basketball; basketball player; bradykinesia; dystonia; electroencephalogram; fatigue; foot; football player; functional connectivity; gait; heart right ventricle dysplasia; human; hypnosis; Medline; morphometry; motoneuron; motor activity; motor control; motor dysfunction; muscle action potential; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; performance anxiety; prevalence; questionnaire; range of motion; Review; risk factor; runner; skating; spine fracture; sport; systematic review; tennis; thalamotomy; training; walking; dystonia; dystonic disorder; golf; motor dysfunction; Dystonia; Dystonic Disorders; Golf; Humans; Movement Disorders",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123461226

Seventeen male basketball players shoot three sets of 10 free throws with a two-minute break between each set. A three-dimensional motion tracking system composed of 17 sensors sampling at 60 Hz was used for data collection. Proficient free throw shooters had greater knee and elbow flexion, lower elbow height, and a smaller forearm angle compared to non-proficient shooters. These results explained 89.5% of the total variance. While maintaining the optimal range of these kinematic variables allows each subject to reach an appropriate level of free throw shooting performance, the key variable capable of distinguishing between made and missed shots within the proficient group of shooters was the forearm angle. Positioning the forearm parallel, or close to parallel, with an imaginary vertical line during the preparatory phase of the shooting motion accounted for 23.9% of the total variance and was associated with a greater number of made shots. © 2021.

This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effect of exercise on pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and quality of life in children with bronchial asthma. Methods. A comprehensive search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EBSCO, CNKI, and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service platform to identify any relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from inception to April 2021. The Cochrane risk of the bias tool was utilized to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies, and RevMan 5.3 was applied to perform data analyses. Results. A total of 22 RCTs involving 1346 patients were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that exercise had significant advantages in improving lung function and exercising capacity and quality of life in children with asthma compared with conventional treatment, such as the forced vital capacity to predicted value ratio (SMD = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.40, and P<0.0001), the peak expiratory flow to predicted value ratio (MD = 4.53; 95% CI: 1.27, 7.80, and P=0.007), the 6-minute walk test (MD = 110.65; 95% CI: 31.95, 189.34, and P=0.006), rating of perceived effort (MD = -2.28; 95% CI: -3.21, -1.36, and P<0.0001), and peak power (MD = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.37, 1.52, and P=0.001) on exercise capacity and pediatric asthma quality of life questionnaire (MD = 1.28; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.95, and P=0.0002) on quality of life. However, no significant difference was observed in the forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity P=0.25 and the forced expiratory volume at 1 second to predicted value ratioP=0.07.

Deaf athletes appear to struggle with balance and postural stability problems. The purpose of this study was to examine postural sway values in parallel and single leg stance of Olympic deaf basketball and volleyball players and reveal differences between the branches. Twenty-three male athletes from the Turkish national deaf basketball (n=11) and volleyball (n=12) teams participated in the study. After anthropometric measurements, the subjects completed postural sway (PS) tests in parallel/single leg stances with open eyes and closed eyes on a force plate. PS parameters (sway path, velocity, and area) obtained from the device software were used for the statistical analysis. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare differences in PS parameters between basketball and volleyball players, and the alpha value was accepted as 0.05. Volleyball players had significantly better results in parallel stance and dominant leg PS values than basketball players (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in nondominant leg PS values (P> 0.05). We think that proprioceptive and vestibular system enhancing training practices to be performed with stability exercises will be beneficial in terms of both promoting functional stability and interlimb coordination. Trainers and strength coaches should be aware of differences in the postural control mechanism of deaf athletes. © 2021. Korean Society of Exercise Rehabilitation.

Barefoot research has gained popularity in examining how shoes alter natural movements. However, it is unknown how a single leg landing under barefoot conditions, as well as landing height, affects ground reaction forces (GRF). Objective: The purpose of this research was to examine the differences in GRF during a single leg landing under barefoot and shod conditions from various heights. Methods: Sixteen female Division II collegiate athletes, 8 basketball (age: 19.88 ± 0.64 yrs; height: 1.77 ± 0.09 m; mass: 75.76 ± 12.97 kg) and 8 volleyball (age: 20.00 ± 1.07 yrs; height: 1.74 ± 0.08 m; mass: 72.41 ± 5.41 kg), performed single leg landings from 12, 18, 24, and 30 inches barefoot and shod. An AMTI AccuGait force plate was used to record GRF. A 2 (condition) x 4 (box height) x 2 (sport) repeated measures ANOVA was performed to determine any GRF differences. Results: There were no significant three way or two-way interactions (p > 0.05). There was also no main effect for sport (p > 0.05). There were main effects for footwear and box height (p = 0.000) where shod (2295.121 ± 66.025 N) had greater impact than barefoot (2090.233 ± 62.684 N). Conclusions: Single leg barefoot landings resulted in less vertical GRF than shod landings. This could be due to increased flexion at the joints which aids in force absorption. © 2021 The authors.

Methods Twenty-two athletes, 11 basketball players and 11 MMA fighters, 18 men and four women, aged 15–24 years, participated in the study. Saliva samples were collected using sterile saliva containers (Salivette®) from all participants before training (sample 1), immediately after (sample 2), and 30 minutes after training (sample 3). The levels of all investigated biomarkers were measured spectrophotometrically using a biochemical analyzer. Results Statistically significant differences were present among samples 1, 2, and, 3 in the concentrations of urea, AST, and CK in samples collected from MMA fighters (Friedman test). Among three samples taken from basketball players, the significant differences were not observed for the analyzed parameters. When concentrations of all diagnostic markers were compared between basketball and MMA independently for samples 1, 2, and 3, statistically significant differences (Mann–Whitney U-test) existed in concentrations of urea, uric acid, proteins, and AST. Conclusion Based on the results of the present study, the influence of the exercise on the levels of salivary diagnostic markers, such as urea, AST, and CK, is more evident during MMA than basketball training.

Our hypothesis is that the São Paulo (SP) state is the leading player in the Southeastern region and stands out from the other regions. The birthplace of Brazilian athletes participating in the FIBA World Cup and in two national leagues were collected from open-access websites. Three hundred and fifteen athletes’ birthplaces were included. The absolute and relative frequencies of athletes’ birthplaces per state and geographical region were calculated. Chi-Square tests were used to compare the expected and the observed frequencies of birthplaces among regions and states. Odds Ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to indicate the probability of a high-level athlete to be born in a certain region or state. The results completely confirmed our hypothesis, showing higher frequencies of athletes born in the Southeastern region, especially in the SP state. We concluded that the uneven participation in basketball in Brazil is caused by the continental dimensions of the country and the modality historical context.

Objective: To describe the methodological aspects (measurement of bone parameters, body regions, precision errors and covariates) and to compare BMD and BMC by body region (total body, upper limbs, lower limbs and trunk) among university athletes practicing different sports. Methods: A search was performed on the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, EBSCOhost, SportDiscus, LILACS and SciELO. Studies were selected that: (1) compared BMD and BMC of athletes practicing at least two different sports (2) used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess bone parameters (3) focused on university athletes. The extracted data were: place of study, participant selection, participants’ sex, sport practiced, type of study, bone parameters, DXA model, software used, scan and body regions, precision error, precision protocol, covariates and comparison of bone parameters between different sports by body region. Results: The main results were: 1) BMD is the most investigated bone parameter; 2) total body, lumbar spine and proximal femur (mainly femoral neck) are the most studied body regions; 3) although not recommended, the coefficient of variation is the main indicator of precision error; 4) total body mass and height are the most commonly used covariates; 5) swimmers and runners have lower BMD and BMC values; and 6) it is speculated that basketball players and gymnasts have greater osteogenic potential. Conclusions: Swimmers and runners should include weight-bearing exercises in their training routines. In addition to body mass and height, other covariates are important. The results of this review can help guide intervention strategies focused on preventing diseases and health problems during and after the athletic career.

Methods: Cross-sectional study, using a mixed questionnaire, based on the Referred Morbidity Index. Results: 198 amateur and professional BJJ fighters, of both sexes, aged between 18 and 60 years, participated in the study. The majority (88%) of the fighters had only one knee injury (p < 0.001). In total, 29.8% proportion of knee injuries (p < 0.001) was identified, which were mainly from the medial collateral ligament (38%), caused by a sprain mechanism (86%) and conservative treatment (65%). Conclusion: A high prevalence of knee injuries in JJB fighters was found, compared to other sports that also perform rotational movements and have great body contact, such as mixed martial arts (MMA), judo, soccer, basketball and handball. Some JJB strikes, such as the key and the projection, can cause greater knee joint stress, both in the attacking fighter and in the opponent.

In addition, to determine any differences in sleep duration and sleep quality, depending on sport type and competitive level. Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 313 athletes (243 male, 70 female), competing in a variety of sports and competitive level, completed the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and a questionnaire which captured current sleep behaviors. Sleep quality was calculated using the global PSQI score (≥5 indicative of poor sleep quality). Results: On average, athletes self-reported sleep duration was 7:34 ± 1:00 h:min. Overall, 19% of athletes achieved less than 7 h of sleep, 50% achieved less than 8 h. Global PSQI score was 5.0 ± 2.4, with poor sleep quality found in 55% of athletes. Sleep duration was significantly shorter in runners compared to basketball, soccer and rugby players (p < 0.05). Recreational athletes slept significantly less (7:08 ± 0:54 h:min) than competitive (7:32 ± 1:00 h:min), national (7:50 ± 1:00 h:min) and elite level athletes (7:49 ± 0:51 h:min). No differences in sleep quality were found between sport or competitive level. Discussion: Half of the athletes failed to achieve 8 h of sleep per night and the majority reported compromised sleep quality. Sport type and competitive level may influence sleep duration; however, these factors do not seem to cause discrepancies in sleep quality. This study provides novel data into the sleep behaviors of adult athletes, and suggests strategies to improve sleep duration and quality may be warranted. © 2021 Brazilian Association of Sleep and Latin American Federation of Sleep Societies.

However, considering the effect of gender and sport on training, it would be interesting to evaluate simulation-based training in female basketball. Objective: The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of simulation-based training on physical fitness and performance indices in female basketball players. Methods: Sixteen female semi-professional basketball players were randomly assigned to experimental (n=8; age, 25±2 years; weight, 62±9 kg; height, 167±8 cm) or control (n=8; age, 24±1 years; weight, 57±9 kg; height, 170±8 cm) groups. The experimental group participated in a six week basketball simulation training program including running with different speeds (jogging to sprinting), agility, jumping, and shuffling. Both groups performed the Cooper 12 min run, line drill, an adjusted T-test, 20 ms print, the Sargent vertical jump and basketball exercise simulation test before and after six weeks of the study period. Control and experimental groups performed typical basketball training, three times weekly. The overall training volume was similar for both groups. Results: The perceived exertion was higher in the simulation-based training than control (p&lt;0.05) group. The findings of this study indicated a significant increase in VO2 max (p=0.001), anaerobic power (p=0.009), explosive leg strength (p=0.036), and total distance covered in basketball exercise simulation test (p=0.001) and decrease of the meantime of one round of basketball exercise simulation test (p=0.001) in the simulation training compared to the control group. Conclusion: Generally incorporation of the simulation-based training in conditioning programs is recommended for improving aerobic, anaerobic and leg explosive strength of basketball players. © 2021 Javanmardi et al.","Basketball; Female athletes; Performance; Physical fitness; Players; Simulation training","adult; agility; article; athletic performance; basketball player; clinical article; controlled study; exercise; female; human; human experiment; jogging; jumping; leg; randomized controlled trial; running; simulation training; velocity; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118967751

Workload variables included the PD for total distance, distance covered in different intensity zones, accelerations &gt;2 m·s-2 (ACC), decelerations &lt;-2 m·s-2 (DEC), and PlayerLoad. PD were calculated across different sample durations for each variable. Linear mixed models were used to identify differences in PD between groups based on playing times. PD for total distance (5-min window), high-speed running (&gt;18 km·h-1) distance (2-min window), and ACC (30-s, 45-s, 1-min, 2-min, and 5-min windows) were significantly (p &lt;.05) higher for players who completed lower total playing times (16.6 ± 2.4 min) than players who completed higher total playing times (25.0 ± 3.4 min).

Purpose: To provide a qualitative summary of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have examined the effectiveness of sports injury prevention programs on reducing musculoskeletal injuries. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We searched the PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases for systematic reviews and meta-analyses that evaluated the effectiveness of sports injury prevention programs. We excluded published abstracts, narrative reviews, articles not published in English, commentaries, studies that described sports injury prevention strategies but did not assess their effectiveness, studies that did not assess musculoskeletal injuries, and studies that did not assess sports-related injuries. The most relevant results were extracted and summarized. Levels of evidence were determined per the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, revised version). Results: A total of 507 articles were retrieved, and 129 were included. Articles pertaining to all injuries were divided into 9 topics: sports and exercise in general (n = 20), soccer (n = 13), ice hockey (n = 1), dance (n = 1), volleyball (n = 1), basketball (n = 1), tackle collision sports (n = 1), climbing (n = 1), and youth athletes (n = 4). Articles on injuries by anatomic site were divided into 11 topics: general knee (n = 8), anterior cruciate ligament (n = 34), ankle (n = 14), hamstring (n = 11), lower extremity (n = 10), foot (n = 6), groin (n = 2), shoulder (n = 1), wrist (n = 2), and elbow (n = 1). Of the 129 studies, 45.7% were ranked as evidence level 1, and 55.0% were evidence level 2. Based on the AMSTAR-2, 58.9% of the reviews reported a priori review methods, 96.1% performed a comprehensive literature search, 47.3% thoroughly described excluded articles, 79.1% assessed risk of bias for individual studies, 48.8% reported a valid method for statistical combination of data (ie, meta-analysis), 45.0% examined the effect of risk of bias on pooled study results, and 19.4% examined the risk for publication bias.

Additionally, those strength and flexibility characteristics are commonly used as clinical tests to monitor progress of athletes with acute or chronic hamstring strains. Although hamstring strains are common among basketball athletes, normative values of knee strength and flexibility characteristics are scarce. Normative values for these athletes would be important in prevention and management of hamstring strains. Purpose To establish quadriceps and hamstring isokinetic strength and flexibility values among high school basketball athletes and examine the effects of sex and age. Study Design Cross-sectional research Methods Isokinetic knee muscular strength (concentric quadriceps [QuadC], concentric hamstring [HamC], eccentric hamstring [HamE], and strength ratios ([HamC/QuadC and HamE/ Quad]), flexibility of hip flexors and quadriceps during a Modified Thomas test, and flexibility of hip extensors and hamstring during passive straight leg raise (SLR) and passive knee extension (PKE) tests were measured. Effects of sex and age were analyzed using t-tests and analysis of variance, respectively with Bonferroni corrected post hoc tests (p≤0.01). Results A total of 172 high school basketball athletes (64 males/108 females; mean age (range): 15.7 (14-18) years old) participated in the study. Male athletes were significantly stronger than female athletes (QuadC: p<0.001; HamC: p<0.001) while no differences were observed in strength ratio (HamC/QuadC: p=0.759-0.816; HamE/QuadC: p=0.022-0.061). Among male athletes, a significant effect of age on quadriceps and hamstring strength was observed: older male athletes were stronger than younger male athletes. Contrarily, there were no effects of age on strength among female athletes. There were significant sex differences in quadriceps flexibility, SLR, and PKE (female athletes were more flexible; p=0.001-0.005) while no sex differences were found in hip flexor flexibility (p=0.105-0.164). There were no effects of age for any flexibility variables within male and female athletes (p=0.151-0.984). Conclusion The current results provide normative values for hamstring strength and flexibility in high school basketball athletes. These normative values may further assist sports medicine specialists to develop screening tests, interventions, and return-to-sport criteria in this population. © 2021, North American Sports Medicine Institute.

Recent work has demonstrated highly specific balance behavior that is often not easily reconciled with conventional theories of postural control. Purpose The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of sport-specific training history on directional profiles of center of pressure (COP) displacement and velocity among collegiate athletes. Study Design Cross-Sectional Study. Methods One-hundred sixty-seven NCAA Division-I varsity athletes (80 female: 19.12±1.08 years, 169.79±7.03 cm, 65.69±10.43 kg; 87 male: 19.59±1.33 years, 181.25±9.06 cm, 76.40±12.73 kg) representing four sports (basketball, soccer, tennis, and cross county) participated in this study. Participants balanced barefoot with eyes closed on a force plate for 10-s. in double leg and single leg stance. Effects of sport on mean COP velocity and total displacement were assessed within eight non-overlapping directions (i.e. heading bins). Results Greater double leg COP displacement and velocity were observed within specific heading bins in cross country athletes when compared to soccer athletes. Greater double leg COP velocity was also observed in multiple heading bins in basketball athletes when compared to soccer athletes. Greater single leg (non-dominant limb) COP displacement was observed in the 135° heading bin in basketball athletes when compared to soccer athletes. Conclusions The observed effects are likely attributable to sport-specific sensorimotor adaptations, including lower extremity strength/power, proprioceptive acuity, and efficiency of integrating vestibular information. Other potential mechanism—namely the involvement of cutaneous feedback and/or muscle synergies—deserve consideration. Directional profiling of spontaneous COP motion may improve understanding of sport-related balance behavior, enhancing its application in therapeutic and performance monitoring contexts.

The Y-Balance Test Lower Quarter (YBT-LQ) has emerged as a tool to identify these deficits. Purpose To review the reliability of the YBT-LQ, determine if performance on the YBT-LQ varies among populations (i.e., sex, sport/activity, and competition level), and to determine the injury risk identification validity of the YBT-LQ based on asymmetry, individual reach direction performance, or composite score. Study Design Systematic Review Methods A comprehensive search was performed of 10 online databases from inception to October 30, 2019. Only studies that tested dynamic single leg balance using the YBT-LQ were included. Studies were excluded if the Y-Balance Test kit was not utilized during testing or if there was a major deviation from the Y-Balance test procedure. For methodological quality assessment, the modified Downs and Black scale and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used. Results Fifty-seven studies (four in multiple categories) were included with nine studies assessing reliability, 36 assessing population differences, and 16 assessing injury prediction were included. Intra-rater reliability ranged from 0.85-0.91. Sex differences were observed in the posteromedial direction (males: 109.6 [95%CI 107.4-111.8]; females: 102.3 [95%CI 97.2-107.4; p = 0.01]) and posterolateral direction (males: 107.0 [95%CI 105.0-109.1]; females: 102.0 [95%CI 97.8-106.2]). However, no difference was observed between sexes in the anterior reach direction (males: 71.9 [95%CI 69.5-74.5]; females: 70.8 [95%CI 65.7-75.9]; p=0.708). Differences in composite score were noted between soccer (97.6; 95%CI 95.9-99.3) and basketball (92.8; 95%CI 90.4-95.3; p <0.01), and baseball (97.4; 95%CI 94.6-100.2) and basketball (92.8; 95%CI 90.4-95.3; p=0.02). Given the heterogeneity of injury prediction studies, a meta-analysis of these data was not possible. Three of the 13 studies reported a relationship between anterior reach asymmetry reach and injury risk, three of 10 studies for posteromedial and posterolateral reach asymmetry, and one of 13 studies reported relationship with composite reach asymmetry. Conclusions There was moderate to high quality evidence demonstrating that the YBT-LQ is a reliable dynamic neuromuscular control test. Significant differences in sex and sport were observed. If general cut points (i.e., not population specific) are used, the YBT-LQ may not be predictive of injury. Clinical population specific requirements (e.g., age, sex, sport/ activity) should be considered when interpreting YBT-LQ performance, particularly when used to identify risk factors for injury.

Field and court-based sports such as basketball, football, hockey, soccer, among others, require explosive multiplanar movement in single stance and high-speed change of direction. Often situations arise where sub-optimal pre-season training has occurred or congested in-season competition minimizes physiologic recovery periods between bouts of physical activity, both of which could magnify concomitant existing risk factors and increase injury risk. Identification and management of HAGI can be challenging as numerous structures within the region can be drivers of pain and injury, especially when considering the likelihood of concurrent pathology and injury reoccurrence. Focused prevention strategies have been suggested, but their practical clinical implementation has not been heavily investigated across the sporting spectrum. The purpose of this commentary is to review the historical and current state of HAGI, while focusing on applying evidence and clinical experience towards the development of future risk reduction strategies.

This study investigated the effect of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), Kinesio® tape (KT), and PNF combined with KT (PNF + KT) for hamstring flexibility and jumping performance in amateur athletes with hamstring tightness. Methods. overall, 128 amateur athletes were randomly assigned to the PNF (n = 32), KT (n = 32), PNF + KT (n = 32) or control group (n = 32). Flexibility was assessed with active straight leg raise (ASLR) test with a digital goniometer. Performance was evaluated by vertical jump (VJ) and triple hop distance (THd) tests. All measurements were performed by a blinded assessor 3 times: at baseline, immediately after the interventions, and 30 minutes after the interventions. Results. Amateur athletes receiving PNF or KT or PNF + KT demonstrated a greater increase in ASLR and THd tests from baseline to post-intervention scores (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.001 for ASLR; p = 0.001 in all groups for THd, respectively) and from baseline to 30 minutes after intervention (p = 0.001 in all groups for ASLR; p = 0.001 in all groups for THd, respectively). Nevertheless, only the PNF + KT group presented a greater increase in VJ test from baseline to post-intervention scores (p = 0.02).

Deficits in postural stability have been associated with several lower extremity injuries. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in static postural stability between male and female intercollegiate athletes with and without visual information. Hypothesis There will be no difference in visual reliance between sexes during static postural stability. Study Design Cross-sectional Study Methods Static postural stability was assessed during a single session for football, soccer, basketball, and volleyball intercollegiate athletes (males, n=135, females, n=51) under eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions via performance of single limb stance on a force plate. Ground reaction force component data in all directions were quantified as a unitless composite score (COMP) where lower values indicated better postural stability. The absolute change and percentage change between EO and EC conditions were calculated for each sex. Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to compare differences between sexes. Results Males had greater EO COMP (males=7.77±3.40; females=6.48±4.61; p=0.038; Cohen’s d=0.343) and EC COMP (males=19.43±8.91; females 14.66±6.65; p=0.001; Cohen’s d=0.571) than females. A significant difference in absolute change from EO to EC was observed between sexes (males=-11.65±7.05; females=-8.18±5.61; p=0.01, Cohen’s d=-0.520) indicating that males had a greater change between conditions for the worse. There was no significant difference in percent change from EO to EC between sexes (males=159.2±90.7; females=156.7±109.2; p=0.39; Cohen’s d=0.026). Conclusions The observed differences between males and females in EO COMP, EC COMP, and absolute difference in COMP indicate that there is some factor that causes a difference in static postural stability between sexes. No difference in percent change between groups indicates that the difference in static postural stability between sexes may not be due to visual reliance. Female athletes may inherently have better postural stability than males, but both sexes were able to compensate for the loss of visual input.

Currently, minority and female representation among orthopaedic surgeons remains low. Given the large proportion of minority athletes and their degree of public visibility, professional sports serves as an important arena within which to analyze the diversity of health care providers. Purpose: To describe and evaluate the current level of diversity of head team physicians (HTPs) and head athletic trainers (ATCs), primarily in terms of race and sex, within men’s professional sports leagues in the United States. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Five major US professional sports leagues were evaluated: National Basketball Association, National Football League, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, and Major League Baseball. Publicly available data were collected to identify the HTPs and head ATCs for each team within these leagues. Two independent observers analyzed photographs and names of these individuals to determine his or her perceived race and sex, with disagreements being resolved by a third independent observer. Other physician data collected included graduate degree(s), specialty, and number of years in practice. Kappa coefficients (κ) were employed to evaluate interobserver reliability. Chi-square, Fisher exact, and t tests were used for statistical comparisons across leagues. Results: The κ values for perceived race were 0.85 for HTPs and 0.89 for head ATCs, representing near-perfect interobserver agreement. Minorities comprised 15.5% of HTPs and 20.7% of ATCs (P =.24). Women comprised 3.9% of HTPs and 1.3% of head ATCs (P =.017). The majority of HTPs were orthopaedic surgeons with medical doctorates. Female HTPs had significantly fewer years in practice compared with male HTPs (15.0 ± 4.9 vs 23.1 ± 9.6; P =.04). Conclusion: The lead physicians and athletic training providers for men’s professional sports teams demonstrated low rates of minority and female representation, denoting a highly visible area for discussing the role of increased diversity in health care. © The Author(s) 2021.","diversity; professional sports; race; sex","adult; article; athletic trainer; baseball; basketball; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; football; hockey; human; interrater reliability; kappa statistics; male; orthopedic surgeon; perception; photography; race; soccer; training; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117065355

The accurate application of basketball technical movements in the basketball game is very important. Therefore, it is of great significance to capture and standardize athletes' movements and improve their training. Unfortunately, there are numerous issues in traditional classroom teaching that largely helps to train the athletes. To solve the issues of traditional basketball classroom teaching, a virtual simulation system for students' sports training is designed in this paper. Firstly, the information of basketball dribbling movement is captured and simulated in three dimensions. Secondly, we compare it with the standard database to judge the irregularities of athletes' movements, and carry out digital processing on athletes' movements and skill improvements statistics in combination with system functions. Thirdly, we set up a gradual training cycle. Finally, the Kinect-based capture technology is adopted to obtain the activity information of different joints of the human body. Through processing the motion data, relevant motion analysis data are fed to the established motion model, to realize the comparative analysis of motion pictures.

However, findings are equivocal, possibly due to heterogeneity in the techniques used for measuring blood flow, the garment types used, and the pressures applied. This study combined Doppler ultrasound and near-infrared spectroscopy technologies to provide the first comprehensive assessment of the effects of 3 sports compression garment types on markers of venous return and muscle blood flow at rest. Methods: Resting lower-limb blood flow measures (markers of venous return, muscle blood flow, and muscle oxygenation) of 22 elite, junior, male basketball players (age = 17.2 ± 0.9 years, mean ± SD) were assessed in 4 separate conditions: no compression (CON), compression tights (TIGHTS), compression shorts (SHORTS), and compression socks (SOCKS). Markers of venous return (cross-sectional area, time-averaged mean and peak blood flow velocity, and venous blood flow) were measured via Doppler ultrasound at the popliteal and common femoral veins. Muscle blood flow and muscle oxygenation were measured in the gastrocnemius medialis and vastus lateralis using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Popliteal markers of venous return were higher in TIGHTS compared to CON (p < 0.01) and SHORTS (p < 0.01), with SOCKS values higher compared with CON (p < 0.05). Common femoral vein markers of venous return were higher for all conditions compared to CON (p < 0.05), with TIGHTS values also higher compared to SOCKS (p < 0.05). Gastrocnemius medialis blood flow was higher for TIGHTS compared to CON (p = 0.000), SOCKS (p = 0.012), and SHORTS (p = 0.000), with SOCKS higher compared to SHORTS (p = 0.046). Vastus lateralis blood flow was higher for TIGHTS compared to CON (p = 0.028) and SOCKS (p = 0.019), with SHORTS also higher compared to CON (p = 0.012) and SOCKS (p = 0.005). Gastrocnemius medialis oxygenation was higher for TIGHTS compared to CON (p = 0.003), SOCKS (p = 0.033), and SHORTS (p = 0.003), with SOCKS higher compared to CON (p = 0.044) and SHORTS (p = 0.032). Vastus lateralis oxygenation was higher for TIGHTS compared to CON (p = 0.020) and SOCKS (p = 0.006). Conclusion: Markers of venous return, muscle blood flow, and muscle oxygenation are increased with sports compression garments. TIGHTS are most effective, potentially because of the larger body area compressed. © 2021","Arterial perfusion; Lower-limb compression; Pressure; Venous flow",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115971228

First, we use a new swarm intelligence optimization cuckoo search algorithm because the algorithm has fewer parameters, powerful global search ability, and support of fast convergence. Second, we apply the traditional K-clustering algorithm to improve the final output using clustering means in Spark distributed environment. Last, we examine the aspects that could lead to high-pressure game circumstances to study professional athletes' defensive performance. Both recruiters and trainers may use our technique to better understand essential player's qualities and eventually, to assess and improve a team's performance.

No previous studies have examined the economic impact of ACL tears in the NBA. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to examine the economic impact of ACL tears on NBA players and teams by calculating the costs of recovery (COR) and classifying players based on preinjury success level (All-Star or equivalent, starter, or reserve) and salary (in US$ million: <1.5, 1.5-4, or >4 per season). It was hypothesized that players with a lower preinjury salary or primarily a reserve role would have decreased costs, lower rates of return to play (RTP), and shorter careers. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: We reviewed the publicly available records of NBA players treated with ACL reconstruction from 2000 to 2015. Data collected included player demographics, player salaries, statistical performance using player efficiency rating (PER), and specifics regarding time missed and RTP rate. Results: A total of 35 players met the study inclusion criteria. The cumulative economic loss from ACL injuries in the NBA from 2000 to 2015 was $99 million. The average COR was $2.9 million per player. RTP rate was 91% overall, with 70% retention at 3 years. Players that made a salary of less than $1.5 million per season before the injury had a significant drop in PER (difference of –7), RTP rate of 63%, and only 37% retention at 3 years. Conversely, recovering All-Star players also had a significant drop in PER (–6.2), and no players repeated as All-Stars in the season after ACL reconstruction (0%), although they did have a 100% RTP rate and an average career length of 5.6 seasons postinjury. Conclusion: While the RTP rate in NBA athletes remained high, ACL reconstruction can result in decreased statistical performance and/or inability to return to prior levels of play. Players who made less than $1.5 million preinjury or played primarily in a reserve role were associated with lower RTP and retention in the NBA at 3 years. © The Author(s) 2021.","ACL reconstruction; basketball; economic analysis","lamivudine; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; basketball player; cartilage injury; clinical article; cost effectiveness analysis; demography; descriptive research; economic parameters; female; hamstring tendon; health care cost; human; knee injury; knee instability; length of stay; male; range of motion; return to sport; robot-assisted prostatectomy; season",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115611470

Nine coaches participated in the NBB, seasons 2018 and 2019. A semi-structured interview was used. After the literal transcription of interviews, the content was analyzed from meaning-units (MUs). The coaches highlighted the inefficiency of schools in developing the motor coordination of students, and the precarious physical structure for the practice of basketball. The interviewees noted that in the absence of public spaces for practicing sports and in the absence of a national program that democratize the sports is a serious problem that need to be faced. They comment that college basketball does not contribute effectively to the development of Brazilian athletes towards professionalism Furthermore, sports institutions do not present a suitable structure to develop athletes. In the youth category, there are few federated teams, and consequently a few competitions and official matches played. It is concluded, by the coaches' perception, which in Brazil there is a precariousness in the actions of educational, governmental and sports institutions in developing male basketball players in the youth category. © 2021 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

Fourteen male basketball players aged 16.64±.50 years, divided in control group (n=7) and experimental group (n=7), were assessed on free-throw, two-point and three-point shooting performance and on four kinematic parameters (release height, release angle, release speed and trajectory variability), before and after a five-week training program. During the five-week period, the experimental group accomplished a shooting training program that included 600 shots per week. Both groups maintained their regular basketball practice. The results show that the experimental group significantly increased their shooting performance on three-point (p<.05) and on free-throw (p<.05). Moreover, a significant decrease in three-point ball release angle (p<.05) and a significant increase in free-throw ball release height (p<.05) were observed in the experimental group, while the control group significantly increased the two-point ball release speed (p<.05). In conclusion, self-shooting basketball practice, in addition to formal practice, significantly improves shooting performance of young basketball players. In contrast, the reduced changes on the analysed kinematic parameters caused by the self-training program are most likely a consequence of the absence of external feedback during training process. © 2021 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

Five typical interest-oriented sport classes were selected due to the difference in sport characteristics: basketball, swimming, tennis, taekwondo, and archery. Statistical analyses, ANOVA analysis, and multiple comparisons (with least significant difference, LSD) were applied to the collected data. It has been found that boys and girls have similar self-efficacy of adolescent sports health. Adolescents' self-efficacy of sports health has significant differences among different sports items, where the basketball group scored the highest. Adolescents in the professional level have the highest self-efficacy of sports health, whereas the skillful level and beginner level have no significant difference. The male students are more enthusiastic and fond of sports than female students. There are significant differences between sports commitment and sports health of adolescents in different sports, where the basketball group scored the highest. Exercise induces higher score of sports commitment; however, no significant difference is observed for the skillful level and the beginner level. The significant positive correlation is found between sports health and self-efficacy and sports commitment, self-efficacy, and sports commitment. Besides, the role of self-efficacy is partial intermediary between sports health and sports commitment. © 2021 Qiaoyin Tan and Weide Shao.",,"adolescent; alternative medicine; analysis of variance; Article; basketball; child; controlled study; exercise; female; health promotion; human; human experiment; male; mediation analysis; questionnaire; self concept; Student t test; swimming; taekwondo; tennis; youth sport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115157205

Purpose: To assess the impact patellar tendinopathy has on workload, player performance, and career longevity in NBA athletes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: NBA players diagnosed with patellar tendinopathy between the 2000-2001 and 2018-2019 seasons were identified through publicly available data. Characteristics, return to play (RTP), player statistics, and workload data were compiled. The season of diagnosis was set as the index year, and the statistical analysis compared post- versus preindex data acutely and in the long term, both within the injured cohort and with a matched healthy NBA control cohort. Results: A total of 46 NBA athletes were included in the tendinopathy group; all 46 players returned to the NBA after their diagnosis. Compared with controls, the tendinopathy cohort had longer careers (10.50 ± 4.32 vs 7.18 ± 5.28 seasons; P <.001) and played more seasons after return from injury (4.26 ± 2.46 vs 2.58 ± 3.07 seasons; P =.001). Risk factors for patellar tendinopathy included increased workload before injury (games started, 45.83 ± 28.67 vs 25.01 ± 29.77; P <.001) and time played during the season (1951.21 ± 702.09 vs 1153.54 ± 851.05 minutes; P <.001) and during games (28.71 ± 6.81 vs 19.88 ± 9.36 minutes per game; P <.001). Players with increased productivity as measured by player efficiency rating (PER) were more likely to develop patellar tendinopathy compared with healthy controls (15.65 ± 4.30 vs 12.76 ± 5.27; P =.003). When comparing metrics from 1 year preinjury, there was a decrease in games started at 1 year postinjury (−12.42 ± 32.38 starts; P =.028) and total time played (−461.53 ± 751.42 minutes; P =.001); however, PER at 1 and 3 years after injury was unaffected compared with corresponding preinjury statistics. Conclusion: NBA players with a higher PER and significantly more playing time were more likely to be diagnosed with patellar tendinopathy.

Many talented athletes have had their careers cut short due to sports injuries. Preventing sports injuries is the best way for basketball players to reduce sports injuries. Many coaches and athletes on sports teams, on the other hand, are unaware of the importance of sports injury prevention. They only realize that the body's sports functions are abnormal when it suffers from sports injuries. As a result, this paper proposes a gray theory neural network-based athlete injury prediction model. First, from the standpoint of a single model, the improved unequal interval model is used to predict sports injury by optimizing the unequal interval model in gray theory. The findings show that it is a good predictor of sports injuries, but it is a poor predictor of the average number of injuries. Following that, in order to overcome the shortcomings of a single model, a gray neural network combination model was used. A combination model of the unequal time interval model and BP neural network was determined and established. The prediction effect is significantly improved by combining the gray neural network mapping model and the coupling model to predict the two characteristics of sports injuries. Finally, simulation experiments show that the proposed method is effective. © 2021 Fengyan Zhang et al.",,"Backpropagation; Basketball; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Sports medicine; Average numbers; BP neural networks; Combination models; Coupling modeling; Gray neural networks; Injury prediction; Sports injuries; Training process; Neural networks; accident prevention; adult; Article; artificial neural network; basketball; basketball player; female; grey theory neural network; human; human experiment; predictive value; predictor variable; simulation; sport injury; theoretical model; athlete; sport injury; Athletes; Athletic Injuries; Basketball; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114605551

Purpose: To (1) describe knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of parents of youth basketball players regarding sport specialization and college scholarships and (2) examine potential differences in child basketball participation characteristics based on parent income. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A total of 805 parents (mean age, 39.9 ± 7.1 years; 353 female [43.9%]) of youth basketball players (mean age, 12.9 ± 2.5 years; 241 female [29.9%]) were recruited via Qualtrics Online Panels to complete an anonymous online questionnaire. Participants were required to be a parent of a child between 8 and 18 years of age who participated in organized youth basketball (ie, school, club, or recreational/local league). Participants were recruited to be nationally representative with regard to race/ethnicity (White, 62.7%; Hispanic/Latino of any race, 15.3%; African American/Black, 13.3%; Asian, 4.6%; ≥2 races, 2.9%; American Indian/Alaskan Native, 1.1%; Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, 0.1%). The questionnaire was adapted from previous research on parent knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs and consisted of 3 sections: (1) parent and child characteristics; (2) child basketball participation information (months per year of basketball participation, sport specialization status, receiving private coaching, traveling regularly for basketball competitions, participating on multiple teams at the same time); and (3) parent attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge regarding sport specialization and college basketball scholarships. Results: Most parents believed specialization increased their child’s chances of making a high school (71.4%) or college team (69.7%). Parents underestimated the availability of college basketball scholarships at the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Division I and II levels (8.9 ± 5.1 vs reality of 13-15 per team) but overestimated availability at the Division III level (8.6 ± 5.7 vs reality of 0 per team).

There is a paucity of data regarding career performance in Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) athletes with a history of ACL reconstruction. Purpose: To determine whether WNBA athletes with a history of ACL injury prior to professional play have reduced career game utilization, defined as games played and started and minutes per game (MPG), as well as statistical performance, defined by player efficiency rating (PER). Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Included were 42 WNBA players from 1997 to 2018 who had a history of ACL reconstruction before entering professional leagues. Body mass index (BMI), age, and position were collected for each player. Career data and performance statistics were likewise collected for each player’s entire WNBA career. A control group of WNBA players with no history of ACL injury were matched by position, BMI, and age at the time of WNBA debut. Statistics compared game utilization and performance to assess the impact of ACL reconstruction. Results: Athletes who sustained an ACL tear before entering the league played in fewer games per season in their first 3 professional seasons compared with healthy controls (24.2 ± 8.4 vs 28.2 ± 6.1; P =.02). Among athletes with a history of ACL reconstruction, 11 (26.2%) played only a single WNBA season, while no control athletes played in just 1 season. Additionally, athletes who had a previous ACL tear started significantly fewer games per season (9.0 ± 9.4 vs 14.0 ± 9.0; P <.01) and played fewer MPG (15.5 ± 7.2 vs 20.7 ± 5.5; P <.01) during their WNBA career. Athletes with a history of ACL tear had significantly shorter WNBA careers (4.8 ± 4.1 vs 8.1 ± 3.3 seasons; P <.001). Total professional play duration (WNBA + overseas) was significantly reduced in players with an ACL tear compared with controls (P <.05). PER was not significantly different between cohorts at any time point. Conclusion: WNBA athletes with a history of an ACL tear before professional play had decreased career game utilization and workload throughout their career despite having similar PER compared with healthy controls. © The Author(s) 2021.","ACL; basketball; female athlete; knee","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; athlete; athletic performance; basketball; body mass; cell count; cohort analysis; concussion; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; knee injury; knee meniscus rupture; leg injury; limb fracture; medial collateral ligament; retrospective study; risk factor; workload; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114120288

Dyad (peer) feedback may be a more cost-effective method to deliver feedback to athletes. Purpose To determine the immediate effects of dyad versus expert feedback on drop landing kinematics and kinetics in female athletes. Study Design Cohort study Setting College gymnasium Methods Two teams (one female basketball and one female volleyball), from a local college, were team randomized to dyad feedback (volleyball team) or expert feedback (basketball team) (13 expert, 19±0.87years, 1.7±0.09m, 68.04±7.21kg) (10 dyad 19.4±1.07years, 1.73±0.08m, 72.18±11.23kg). Participants completed drop vertical jumps at two different time points (pre-and post-feedback). Knee flexion and abduction displacement were assessed with Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) was assessed with a force plate during the landing phase of the drop vertical jump and compared across groups and condition (pre-and post-feedback) with a repeated measures ANCOVA a priori α <0.02 was set for multiple tests conducted. Results There were no significant differences between groups for flexion displacement. There was a significant change pre-to post-(decrease 4.65˚ p=0.01) in abduction displacement, with no group effect. There was a significant interaction of group by condition (p=0.01) for vGRF with no difference between groups before feedback (p>0.05). Between groups there was a decrease of vGRF in the expert group (difference 0.45 N*bw-1, p=0.01) at post-feedback relative to dyad. Within the expert group there was a significant difference between pre-and post-feedback (difference 0.72 N*bw-1, p=0.01), while the dyad group did not change pre-to post-feedback (difference 0.18 N*bw-1, p=0.67). Conclusion Movement screening experts giving real-time feedback were successful in improving key injury-risk kinematics and kinetics in female athletes, while dyad feedback only improved kinematics, indicating that expert feedback may be needed to ensure changes in kinematics and kinetics.

To tackle students’ physical inactivity, reforms in higher education were supposed to reinvent physical education (PE) programs, revise their objectives and tasks. Nevertheless, European universities are experiencing a physical activity crisis, and recent generations of students are facing health problems due to underprovided levels of PA. Objective: The aim of this descriptive study was to analyze the state and status of physical education in higher education in selected European countries with regards to its curriculum and resources. Methods: Quantitative data were collected from 66 tertiary institutions from various countries in Europe. The questionnaire was used to gather information regarding characteristics of tertiary institutions, sport and leisure facilities, types and characteristics of PA programs available for students. Results: PE classes were obligatory in 44% and facultative in 30.3% of tertiary institutions; 22.7% of the institutions offered mixed PE curricula. The most popular team sports were volleyball, soccer and basketball, whereas fitness and functional training were the most popular types of individual PA. PE sessions lasted one or two semesters in 53% of the institutions. In 12% of establishments, PE was not part of curricula. In 60% of institutions, PE curricula consisted of 31–60 academic hours during the entire study program, and 55% of establishments charged additional fees for sports activities. In 55% of the analyzed institutions, physical fitness assessments were conducted only to determine students’ eligibility to participate in team sports. Conclusions: The research study investigated problems of insufficient PA levels in higher education, indicating several reasons for this state of affairs. The study recommends that PE curricula are thoughtfully planned and executed with improved financing. Furthermore, PE ought to be combined with health education to promote active and healthy lifestyles among students. © 2021 The Author(s).","Conditions; Evaluation; Fitness; Higher education; Post-secondary education",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112639548

Background: In people with underlying, often unknown, cardiovascular abnormalities, increased cardiovascular load during exercise can trigger sport-related sudden cardiac death. Prevention remains the only weapon to contrast sport-related sudden cardiac death. So far, no reference values have been proposed for electrocardiograms of athletes acquired with wearable sensors in the pre-exercise phase, consisting of the few minutes immediately before the beginning of the training session. Objective: To perform an initial investigation of athletes’ electrocardiograms acquired by wearable sensors during the pre-exercise phase. Methods: The analyzed electrocardiograms, acquired through BioHarness 3.0 by Zephyr, belong to 51 athletes (Sport Database and Cycling Database of the Cardiovascular Bioengineering Lab of the Università Politecnica delle Marche, Italy). Preliminary values consist of interquartile ranges of six electrocardiographic features which are heart rate, heart-rate variability, QRS duration, ST level, QT interval, and corrected QT interval. Results: For athletes 35 years old or younger, preliminary values were [72;91]bpm, [26;47]ms, [85;104]ms, [-0.08;0.08]mm, [326;364]ms and [378;422]ms, respectively. For athletes older than 35 years old, preliminary values were [71;94]bpm, [16;65]ms, [85;100]ms, [-0.11;0.07]mm, [330;368]ms and [394;414]ms, respectively. Conclusion: Availability of preliminary reference values could help identify those athletes who, due to electrocardiographic features out of normal ranges, are more likely to develop cardiac complications that may lead to sport-related sudden cardiac death. © 2021 Romagnoli et al.","Athlete; Pre-exercise electrocardiography; Prevention; Sport-related sudden cardiac death; Sports cardiology; Training session; Wearable sensors","adult; Article; athlete; basketball; biomechanics; cardiologist; cardiorespiratory fitness; cardiovascular bioengineering; cardiovascular load; cardiovascular mortality; cycling; data base; dynamics; electrocardiography; exercise; female; fitness; heart beat; heart rate; heart rate variability; high frequency noise; human; human experiment; jogging; large scale prevention program; male; maximal oxygen uptake; maximal voluntary contraction; middle aged; middle distance running; normal human; physical activity; preexercise phase; QRS interval; QT interval; QTc interval; R wave; recovery phase; sport; sports related cardiac death; ST level; sudden cardiac death; T wave; tennis; training; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112610680

In 344 players of 5 different sports (soccer, classical ballet, gymnastics, volleyball and basketball), mean age 12.0 ± 2.4 years, sex (male/female: 237/107), BMI 19.0 ± 2.8 (Kg/m2), AJM was evaluated by using an inclinometer while the trunk flexibility was evaluated by the Sit and Reach test. Compared to all other groups, soccer players showed a significant reduction of AJM (p <.005) that is already present in younger subjects and that tends to worsen with aging (p <.04). On the contrary, the young dancers of classic ballet showed a significant increase in the AJM (p <.002). Basketball, volleyball and gymnastics groups showed a similar AJM. The higher AJM showed by females compared to males (128.5 ± 21.0° vs 144.6 ± 18.5°; p <.001) was not significant when the group of soccer players and dancers were excluded from the calculation. All groups investigated did not show a different mobility between the two ankles or the dominant and non-dominant limb. The age of the subjects investigated was not correlated with AJM. The group of gymnasts showed a significant increase in trunk flexibility (p <.001) compared to all other groups. Sport practice can significantly modify AJM both by increasing and reducing it.

Samples were gathered from the archival data of the 2019–2020 regular season of the league. Sixteen game-related statistics were analysed: two- and three-point field-goals (both successful and unsuccessful), free-throws (both successful and unsuccessful), defensive and offensive rebounds, assists, steals, turnover, blocks, second-chance points, fast break points, fouls committed and received. The data were clustered into different game types based on the final outcome point differences: all games, balanced games (11 points and below) and unbalanced games (12 points and above). Discriminant function analysis was conducted to identify the performance indicators that classify winning and losing games. The results revealed that winning and losing in balanced games were discriminated by successful two-point field goals, unsuccessful two-point field goals, unsuccessful three-point field goals, successful free-throws, assists, steals, blocks, second-chance points, fast-break points, fouls committed, and fouls received. For unbalanced games, winning and losing were distinguished by successful two-point field goals, successful three-point field goals, successful free-throws, unsuccessful free-throws, defensive rebounds, blocks, fast-break points, and fouls received.

Data from eleven U18 players (age: 16.92 ± 0.67 years) were collected using inertial movement units. As external load variables, Player Load (PL), accelerations (ACC), decelerations (DEC), changes of direction (COD), and jumps (JUMP) were expressed in their total (t) and high intensity (h) values. The analysis of variances (ANOVA) and effect size (ES, Cohen’s d) with their respective 90% confidence intervals were applied to identify differences between the competitions. U18T showed the highest values in PL, tACC, tDEC, hDEC, tCOD, tJUMP, and hJUMP (small to moderate ES). However, the hACC and hCOD values were greater in EBA (small ES) than in U18L and U18T. In conclusion, all three competitions presented different external load demands for the same group of players. This data could help basketball coaches to optimize the training process based on the competition in which their team plays. Furthermore, data could also indicate the most suitable competition for players’ development. © 2021. by the author(s). License MSA, Podgorica, Montenegro.

Purpose: To investigate RTS and outcome expectations of adolescent patients and their parents before ACLR and determine any differences between groups. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, sets of patients (aged 10 to 18 years) and parents were separately asked to complete the same questionnaire relating to knowledge and expectations regarding the patient’s upcoming ACLR. The custom survey consisted of 12 questions and was administered before being seen by a single sports medicine surgeon in the clinical setting of a tertiary care referral center from June 2019 through June 2020. Statistical analysis was performed to compare differences between patient and parent/guardian responses. Results: 28 sets of patients (53.6% female) and parents (64.3% female) completed the survey with average ages of 14.5 ± 2.0 years and 45.6 ± 7.0 years, respectively. 75% of families were Caucasian and 85.2% had private insurance. The most common sports played were basketball (25%) and soccer (17.9%). Overall, nearly 68% of consults were for a second opinion. 50% of patients and 82.1% of parents researched or read of ACL injuries and/or surgery prior to the visit. Most patients (46.4%) and parents (51.9%) expected the surgeon to consider full, unrestricted RTS/activities at 9 months. Only 7.1% of patients and 3.7% of parents believed full RTS would occur >12 months. 50% of patients and 67.9% of parents expected RTS at the same level. Both patients (53.6%) and parents (64.3%) believed fear of re-injury was the most common reason for not returning to sport or returning at a decreased level. There were no statistically significant differences in RTS expectations between patients and parents (p>0.05). Most patients (38.5%) believed the risk of graft rupture in adolescent athletes was 5%, whereas most parents (37%) believed the risk to be at 25%, but the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Both patients and parents believed the risk of graft rupture was highest within the first 6 months (77.8% vs. 50%, respectively). More parents felt the risk of graft rupture was highest within the first year (39.3% vs. 22.2%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Conclusion: Adolescent patients and their parents had similar knowledge and expectations regarding RTS and outcomes following ACLR. Further study is needed to better understand factors affecting those expectations. © The Author(s) 2021.",,"adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; athlete; basketball; clinical article; female; human; male; patient referral; questionnaire; return to sport; Review; rupture; soccer; sports medicine; tertiary health care",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111105080

Neuromuscular training (NMT) serves as a protective factor against ACL injury and serves as a key component of many ACL injury prevention programs. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of an educational workshop for sports coaches on adherence to neuromuscular training (NMT) implementation recommendations. Methods: In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, 22 teams in 8 high schools were randomized to either the intervention or control group. The intervention schools included 12 teams (5 female), and the control schools included 10 teams (4 female). The sports included basketball, volleyball, track and field, baseball, softball, and lacrosse. Coaches in the intervention group participated in a 60-minute educational workshop designed to teach coaches how to effectively implement a NMT program as a warm-up prior to team practice sessions and games. The schools in the control arm received print materials on recommended NMT exercises. Adherence to NMT implementation recommendation by sports coaches was the primary outcome. Eight data collectors, who were blinded to the teams’ assignment, were trained to observe each team’s practice or game 2-3 times a week. At each session, they completed a study questionnaire to identify the exercises completed by athletes during the team’s warm-up. They then recorded whether the coach 1) delivered exercise instructions, and 2) provided corrective cues. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for potential correlations among teams at the same school. Results: A total of 399 practices or games were observed over 2 seasons. A greater proportion of coaches in the intervention group provided cues to correct improper technique compared to coaches in the control group [difference=0.04 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.07, p=0.006]. In addition, more coaches in the intervention group completed a full NMT program [OR=4.62 (1.22, 17.50), p=0.02]. There was a similar proportion of coaches in the intervention and control groups who provided exercise instructions [difference=0.01 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.04), p<0.44]. Conclusions: Coach education can improve adherence to NMT implementation recommendations and the delivery of corrective cues during NMT sessions, which are both critical to reducing the risk of ACL injury. All coaches should receive in-person training that highlights the salience of NMT and provides the knowledge and skills required to effectively implement NMT sessions with young athletes. © The Author(s) 2021.",,"anterior cruciate ligament injury; baseball; basketball; coach; controlled study; exercise; female; human; lacrosse (sport); male; medical education; multicenter study; nonmedical occupations; outcome assessment; protocol compliance; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; Review; softball; track and field; training; volleyball; workshop",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110340595

Twenty-two players were evaluated (11 men, 11 women; age = 21.50 ± 1.74 years, mass = 72.80 ± 13.14 kg, height = 1.71 ± 0.11 m). The functional task of “change of direction in 60°” was registered with a 3D motion analysis system and a force plate. The torques of eversion, plantarflexion, and ankle joint reaction force were evaluated during the braking phase, using an inverse dynamics method. To compare between conditions a t-student or Wilcoxon tests were used. The results revealed that the use of ankle taping yield a decrease in the anterior joint reaction force (WoT = 4.21 ± 1.36 N/kg vs WT = 2.92 ± 1.07 N/kg, p <.0001) and the eversion torque (WoT = 0.56 ± 0.24 Nm/kg vs WT = 0.51 ± 0.20 Nm/kg, p =.02) during a change of direction in 60°. In conclusion, according to the sample of assessed basketball players, the use of this bandage could contribute to the functional stability of the ankle, decreasing the torque of fibularis muscles and the shear anterior-posterior between the shank-foot segments. © Faculty of Education.

It could be considered one of the most demanding team sports due to the FT player’s heart rate mean of approximately 90%, work to rest ratio of 1:1 and activity changes every three seconds. Besides, unlimited number of substitutions, size of the pitch, a smaller ball and constant proximity of the opponent that puts extremely high demands on FT players are the main characteristics of the game. With studies reporting that participating in a FT match provokes muscle damages and inflammations, with a high injury incidence, it is of vital necessity to examine the most efficient methods providing fast recovery of FT players between practice sessions and matches played. Research studies focused on recovery methods in other team sports such as basketball, volleyball, and rugby, among others, reported benefits of passive recovery (massage, water therapy, stretching), active recovery and nutritional techniques. However, for the best of the authors’ knowledge, a limited number of recovery methods has been provided for the game of FT. The most effective recovery methods for FT players are only found to be photobiomodulation therapy and optimal sleeping regimen. Thereby, the main aim of the current narrative review is to present available scientific literature of recovery methods that may have positive effects on FT players. © 2021, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Kinesiology.

Despite our understanding of the effect of AT rupture and in particular its relationship to basketball, no study has examined the effects of AT rupture and repair on performance metrics in collegiate basketball players. Purpose: To evaluate the effect of AT rupture and subsequent surgical repair on performance metrics in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I basketball players who return to play after injury. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: NCAA Division I basketball players who sustained an AT rupture and underwent subsequent surgical repair between 2000 and 2019 were identified by systematically evaluating individual injury reports from databases comprising NCAA career statistics and individual school statistics; 65 male and 41 female players were identified. Athletes were included if they participated in at least one-half of the games of 1 collegiate season before tearing the AT and at least 1 season after operative repair. A total of 50 male and 30 female athletes were included. Each injured athlete was matched to a healthy control by conference, position, starter status at time of injury, class year, and number of games played. Matched controls were healthy players and experienced no significant injuries during their NCAA careers. Results: After AT repair, male athletes had significantly more minutes per game, points per game, and compared with before injury. Total blocks significantly decreased after injury. Female athletes scored significantly more points per game but demonstrated a significantly lower 3-point shooting percentage after return to play. Despite undergoing AT rupture and repair, 14% of male players played in the National Basketball Association, and 20% of injured female athletes played in the Women’s National Basketball Association. Conclusion: After returning to play, men demonstrated a significant drop-off in performance only in regard to total blocks. Female athletes after AT repair demonstrated a significant improvement in points per game but had a significant drop-off in 3-point shooting percentage. © The Author(s) 2021.","Achilles tendon; basketball; NCAA; performance outcomes","achilles tendon rupture; adult; Article; athlete; basketball player; body mass; career; concussion; female; human; major clinical study; male; season; sport; sport injury; tendon reconstruction; tendon rupture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109037238

The ability of referees to respond to the physical and physiological demands imposed during the game is essential for good performance on the court. Objective: To understand the context in which health problems faced by basketball referees occur and to outline the epidemiological profile of musculoskeletal injuries. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in which basketball referees were evaluated using a standardized form. The participants were monitored online weekly for 12 weeks using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center questionnaire to assess health problems, such as diseases (affecting the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive or neurological systems) or musculoskeletal injuries (acute or from overuse). Results: The study sample consisted of 78 referees with a mean age of 36.5 (±9.8) years. Most referees (97.4%) found it important to implement a preventive program. In relation to the health problems reported during follow-up, there was an incidence rate of 23.7 injuries per 1000 hours of play (95% CI 19.5-27.9) and the mean weekly prevalence of diseases was 3.2 (95% CI 0.4 – 6.0) and of injuries was 17.4 (95% CI 16.5 – 18.3). Conclusion: Through this study, it was possible to conclude that there was an incidence rate of 23.7 injuries per 1000 hours of play (95% CI 19.5-27.9) and a mean prevalence of diseases of 3.2 (95% CI 0.4-6.0) and musculoskeletal injuries of 17.4 (95% CI 16.5-18.3).

However, the mecha-nisms of injury protection provided by the ankle braces in the basketball game are still unknown. Objectives: To analyze the effects of wearing a lace-up ankle brace, and to conduct an exercise protocol that simulated the intensity of the basketball game on ground reaction force (GRF) during basketball-specific vertical jumps. Methods: Eleven male younger basketball players aged under 18 completed 48 vertical jumps, with and without ankle braces, during an exercise protocol composed of four 10-minute periods, simulating the activity profile and intensity of the basketball game as well as the typical intervals between periods. Mediolateral (variables: the greatest medial and lateral peaks) and vertical (variables: vertical peak, impulse peak, impulse at 50 ms of landing, loading rate and jump height) GRF were measured during takeoff and landing for all the jumps performed in the exercise protocol. Results: The use of the ankle brace reduced mediolateral GRF in all periods of the exercise protocol during takeoff and landing (P < 0.05), without affecting the vertical GRF (P > 0.05). Mediolateral and vertical GRF (takeoff mediolateral vertical peaks, landing mediolateral peaks, landing impulse peak, takeoff and landing loading rate) increased significantly during four subsequent 10-minute periods (P < 0.05). However, for mediolateral GRF, the increase overtime was higher without braces. Conclusions: The use of the ankle brace reduced the mediolateral GRF on the lower limb, while there was a progressive increase in the external load applied to the body during the vertical jumps in the subsequent periods of the exercise protocol performed at the same intensity of the basketball game.

The research has been conducted during year of 2019 using qualitative and quantitative methods through different sport case studies of three famous basketball and two famous football clubs from Croatia. Although communication of the brand image through its identity is increasingly encouraged in recent scientific literature, it is not yet a common practice in sports in Croatia. Results shows there are no clear links between the brand image and the identity even in Croatian famous professional sport clubs. The sports club's identity is recognized in terms of its existence, social significance, activities, and development to date. The sports brand identity should communicate the core values of the sports club identity. A distinct brand of a sports club is imperative for desirable positioning in the wider environment.

Isolated popliteal injuries, however, are rare. To our knowledge, there are no cases of a female pediatric patient with an intrasubstance popliteal tendon rupture in the current literature. This case report aims to illustrate symptoms, imaging, and treatment of an isolated popliteal tendon rupture in an adolescent female. An athletic 14-year-old female presented with right knee pain 4 weeks after a basketball injury in which she dove for the ball and fell, twisting and striking her knee. She had diffuse pain on both sides of the right knee for 3 weeks and pain with running, jumping or twisting. The knee exam was otherwise unremarkable. A right knee MRI demonstrated a complete rupture of the popliteal tendon. No other knee injuries were visualized. The patient was treated non-operatively and gradually returned to normal activities and sports at 6 weeks post injury. On 6-year follow up, the patient had no residual pain or instability and was able to play basketball without difficulty. Isolated popliteal tendon ruptures are extremely rare and difficult to diagnose given non-specific clinical exam findings. While these ruptures can be difficult to visualize on MRI, imaging can help to clarify the diagnosis by ruling out other injuries with similar clinical presentations. In the case of this young and active patient, diagnosis and full recovery without limitations were achieved with 6 weeks of conservative management. © The Author(s) 2021.","isolated; knee; orthopedic; popliteus; posterolateral corner; rupture","adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament; Article; athlete; basketball; case report; child; clinical article; conservative treatment; diving; exercise; female; femoral condyle; follow up; gastrocnemius muscle; human; jumping; knee function; knee pain; knee radiography; lateral collateral ligament; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patellofemoral joint; popliteus tendon rupture; posterior cruciate ligament; running; soleus muscle; tendon rupture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107434743

A thorough understanding of the anatomy, biomechanics, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of POL injuries will aid orthopaedic surgeons in the management of these injuries. ⁃ The resulting rotational instability, in addition to valgus laxity, may not be tolerated by athletes participating in pivoting sports. The most common mechanism of injury – accounting for 72% of cases – is related to sports activity, particularly football, basketball and skiing. Moreover, three different injury patterns have been reported: those associated with injury to the capsular arm of the semimembranosus (SM), those involving a complete peripheral meniscal detachment and those involving disruption of the SM and peripheral meniscal detachment. ⁃ The hallmark of an injury related to POL lesions is the presence of anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI), which is defined as ‘external rotation with anterior subluxation of the medial tibial plateau relative to the distal femur’. ⁃ In acute settings, POL lesions can be easily identified using coronal and axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and POL appear as separate structures. However, MRI is not sensitive in chronic cases. ⁃ Surgical treatment of the medial side leads to satisfactory clinical results in a multi-ligamentous reconstruction scenario, but it is known to be associated with secondary stiffness. ⁃ In young patients with high functional demands, return to sports is allowed no earlier than 9–12 months after they have undergone a thorough rehabilitation programme. © 2021 The author(s) This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) licence (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed.","multiple ligament injuries; posterior oblique ligament of the knee; posteromedial corner of the knee; sports medicine","Article; athlete; athletic rehabilitation; axial magnetic resonance imaging; basketball; biomechanics; bone radiography; conservative treatment; coronal magnetic resonance imaging; football; human; joint laxity; medial tibial plateau; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical examination; posterior cruciate ligament injury; reconstructive surgery; return to sport; semimembranosus muscle; skiing; sport injury; surgical technique; ultrasound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106585768

Collegiate basketball players often wear different types of footwear depending upon the training activity, potentially influencing CMJ performance outcomes. Objective: This study evaluated the influence of footwear on key CMJ variables used for routine performance assessments in a cohort of 11 NCAA women's collegiate basketball players. Method: In a cross-over repeated measures study design, players performed three CMJs in Basketball-, Training-(Trainers), and Olympic Weightlifting (WL) shoes, in a randomized order during one testing session. One-way repeated measures analyses of variance (p ≤ .05) and effect sizes (Cohen's d) were used to discern differences in CMJ variables among shoe conditions. Results: WL demonstrated greater Eccentric Mean Force (p ≤ .014, d ≥ 0.03) and lower Flight Time:Contraction Time (p ≤ .029, d ≥ 0.31), Jump Height (p ≤ .040, d ≥ 0.32), and Reactive Strength Index-Modified (p ≤ .032, d ≥ 0.40) than both Basketball and Trainers. Additionally, WL exhibited lower Concentric Mean Force (p = .018, d = 0.19), Concentric Mean Power (p = .008, d = 0.29), Eccentric Peak Force (p = .050, d = 0.19), and Flight Time (p = .036, d = 0.31) compared to Trainer. No significant differences and only trivial effects appeared between Basketball and Trainers (p > 0.05, d < 0.1). Conclusion: These findings suggest footwear significantly influences CMJ performance. WL shoes appear to negatively impact CMJ performance; however, Basketball and Trainers appear to exert negligible effects that should allow clinicians and practitioners to feel confident about measurement and data quality when performing short- and long-term CMJ measurements in either Basketball or Trainers. © 2021 JMIR Formative Research.

We recognize that orthobiologic injections are a generally safe treatment modality with a significant potential to reduce pain and expedite early return to play in specific musculoskeletal injuries. The use of orthobiologics in sports medicine to safely reduce time loss and reinjury is of considerable interest, especially as it relates to the potential effect on a professional athlete. While these novel substances have potential to enhance healing and regeneration of injured tissues, there is a lack of robust data to support their regular use at this time. There are no absolutes when considering the implementation of orthobiologics, and unbiased clinical judgment with an emphasis on player safety should always prevail. Current best evidence supports the following: Key Points There is support for the use of leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. There is support for consideration of using leukocyte-rich platelet-rich plasma for patellar tendinopathy. The efficacy of using mesenchymal stromal cell injections in the management of joint and soft tissue injuries remains unproven at this time. There are very few data to suggest that current cell therapy treatments lead to any true functional tissue regeneration. Meticulous and sterile preparation guidelines must be followed to minimize the risk for infection and adverse events if these treatments are pursued. Given the high variability in orthobiologic formulations, team physicians must stay up-to-date with the most recent peer-reviewed literature and orthobiologic preparation protocols for specific injuries. Evidence-based treatment algorithms are necessary to identify the optimal orthobiologic formulations for specific tissues and injuries in athletes. Changes in the regulatory environment and improved standardization are required given the exponential increase in utilization as novel techniques and substances are introduced into clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2021.","BMAC; consensus statement; National Basketball Association; NBA; orthobiologics; PRP","fibroblast growth factor; angiogenesis; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell therapy; chondrocyte; consensus; fracture healing; health care personnel; human; joint injury; knee meniscus rupture; knee osteoarthritis; leukocyte; mesenchymal stroma cell; osteoarthritis; pain; postoperative pain; soft tissue injury; sport injury; standardization; tendinitis; thrombocyte rich plasma; tissue regeneration; walking; wound healing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105683627

The review includes treatment modalities for such injuries. More research is warranted regarding prevention strategies.average year.3 The most common activity at the time of ankle injury is rebounding (34.4% of all ankle injuries) followed by general play, defending, and shooting. Ankle injuries are not only the most common injury sustained while playing basketball, but are also among the most severe and difficult to recover from.9,11 Despite basketball-related ankle injuries accounting for less than a quarter of all injuries, an Australian basketball study found that over half (53.7%) of the playing time missed due to injury was caused by an ankle injury.10,11 Additionally, ankle injuries are often associated with residual chronic symptoms and pathology (ankle instability, chronic pain, weakness, stiffness, and crepitus) that may impact an athlete’s ability to return to play and perform at a high level of competition.12 In this article, we discuss the important aspects of acute and chronic management of ankle injuries among professional basketball players along with the proper steps and protocols for rehabilitation.

Hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) has emerged as a surgical treatment for active individuals with end-stage hip OA to provide pain relief and allow return to high-impact activities. Return to professional sports after HRA has not been well characterized. Purpose/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to report on a series of elite athletes in a variety of sports who underwent HRA. We hypothesized that professional and elite-level athletes would be able to return to sports after HRA for end-stage hip OA. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective case series was conducted on professional athletes who underwent HRA at a single institution between 2007 and 2017. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon using the posterolateral approach. Athletes’ return to play and sport-specific performance statistics were obtained using self-reported and publicly available data sources. Athletes were matched to an age- and performance-based cohort to determine changes in performance-based metrics. Results: Eight professional athletes were identified, including 2 baseball pitchers, 1 ice hockey defenseman, 1 foil fencer, 1 men’s doubles tennis player, 1 basketball player, 1 ultramarathoner, and 1 Ironman triathlete. All 8 patients returned to sports; 6 of 8 (75%) patients were able to return for at least 1 full season at a professional level after surgery. There were no significant differences between performance statistics for athletes who returned to play and their preoperative performance measures for the years leading up to surgery or the age- and performance-matched cohort. Conclusion: HRA remains a surgical alternative for end-stage hip OA in young, high-impact, active patients. While the primary goals of surgery are pain control and quality of life improvement, it is possible to return to elite-level sporting activity after HRA. © The Author(s) 2021.","elite athlete; hip resurfacing arthroplasty; osteoarthritis; return to play","chromium; cobalt; metal ion; adult; Article; athletic performance; athletic rehabilitation; basketball player; clinical article; controlled study; data base; electronic medical record; elite athlete; endurance training; exercise; female; femoroacetabular impingement; fencing (sport); follow up; hip arthroplasty; hip osteoarthritis; hip resurfacing arthroplasty; hockey; human; male; marathon runner; middle aged; muscle strength; performance; physiotherapy; postoperative care; questionnaire; range of motion; retrospective study; return to sport; sport specific performance; tennis; triathlete; triathlon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105497466

Purpose: To discuss the epidemiology of severe NCAA foot injuries sustained over 10 years in 25 sports. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: We utilized the NCAA Injury Surveillance System, which prospectively collects deidentified injury data for collegiate athletes. Severe injuries were classified as season- or career-ending injuries, injuries with >30-day time loss, or injuries requiring operative treatment. Injury rates (IRs) were analyzed per 100,000 athlete-exposures. Results: Of 3607 total foot injuries, 18.71% (n = 675) were classified as severe, with an IR of 5.73 per 100,000 athletic-exposures. For all severe injuries, the operative rate was 24.3%, the season-ending rate 37.0%, and the career-ending rate 4.4%. The proportion of recurrent injuries was 13.9%. Men’s sports with the highest severe foot IRs were basketball (IR = 10.71), indoor track (IR = 7.16), and football (IR = 7.08). Women’s sports with the highest severe foot IRs were cross-country (IR = 17.15), gymnastics (IR = 14.76), and outdoor track (IR = 14.65). Among all severe foot injuries, the most common was a fifth metatarsal fracture. The highest contact/noncontact injury ratios were phalangeal fracture, turf toe, and Lisfranc injury. The severe injuries with the highest operative rates were Lisfranc injuries, fifth metatarsal fractures, and midfoot fractures. The severe injuries associated with the highest season-ending IRs were Lisfranc injury, midfoot fracture, and general metatarsal fractures. Severe flexor/extensor injuries had the highest career-ending IRs, followed by turf toe. Severe injuries with the highest median time loss were sesamoidal fractures, calcaneal fractures, and plantar fascial injuries. Conclusion: Of all collegiate foot injuries sustained over a 10-year period, 18.7% were characterized as severe, and 24.3% of severe injuries required surgery. Basketball was the men’s sport with the highest severe IR, and cross-country was the women’s sport with the highest severe IR. Overall, female athletes experienced slightly higher severe foot IRs as compared with male athletes. © The Author(s) 2021.","athlete; foot injury; NCAA; severe injury","ankle injury; Article; avascular necrosis; basketball; calcaneus fracture; career; cohort analysis; controlled study; contusion; electronic medical record; extensor injury; fat pad syndrome; female; flatfoot; flexor injury; foot fracture; foot injury; football; football player; fracture; gymnastics; health behavior; human; infection; knee injury; leg pain; lisfranc fracture; major clinical study; male; medical procedures; metatarsal fractures; metatarsalgia; muscle spasm; nail avulsion; osteoarthritis; osteophyte; pes cavus; phalanx fracture; plantar fasciitis; prospective study; retrospective study; sesamoid bone; sinus tarsi syndrome; sport; sprain; student athlete; subluxation; turf toe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104984955

Typically, these patients have evident risk factors including, but not limited to, prior abdominal surgery, personal or family history of gastrointestinal disorders, femoral and inguinal hernias, or neoplasm. In this case, we describe an SBO in a female, professional athlete whose swift, severe symptom onset, rapid resolution with conservative treatment, lack of identifiable risk factors, and prompt return to high level competition without recurrence are certainly unique. A female professional basketball player in her mid-20's with no past medical history presented with a seven-hour history of worsening abdominal pain beginning in the epigastric region and migrating to the right lower quadrant. Physical exam did not reveal abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, or high-pitched bowel sounds. Initial differential diagnosis included appendicitis, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and other genitourinary pathology. Computed tomography with contrast revealed distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, and decompressed loops of bowel distally, consistent with an SBO. Symptoms resolved after 24 hours with conservative treatment, including decompression with a nasogastric tube. The athlete returned to full participation five days after initial presentation without recurrence of symptoms. Outpatient gastroenterology workup was negative for predisposing conditions. This presentation is rare in the absence of bowel pathology, family history, or prior abdominal surgery. Perhaps, her profession as an athlete, with frequent air travel and extensive exercise, may have contributed to this unique presentation. This case report should serve as a reminder to all providers that SBOs can occur in young, active patients devoid of risk factors. Even in the absence of typical signs on physical examination, providers should use imaging as adjuncts based on their clinical gestalt and utilize conservative management, when appropriate, to maximize chances of recovery with minimal morbidity.

In strictly homogenized sample of players (N = 58) who matched the inclusion criterion of average playing time and number games in the period 2012-2015, the results indicate that Pre-Draft Combine testing procedures show low to moderate correlations with only few observed basketball performance variables in the first NBA season. The highest correlation was found between upper body strength and number of rebounds (r =.403, p =.002) and blocked shots (r =.333, p =.011). Regression model of Combine performance explained 24.7% of basketball performance with three physical performance tests. Practical application might suggest that some parts of the Combine might be restructured in order to include some other tests more informative tests for the future player performance and player selection. © Faculty of Education.

Bone bruise patterns may provide information regarding injury mechanisms. Purpose: To compare bone bruise and meniscal injury patterns for ACL injuries sustained in soccer versus basketball. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Clinical notes, operative reports, and magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed for patients who sustained a noncontact ACL rupture while playing soccer or basketball between August 2016 and August 2018. The presence, location, and signal intensity of bone bruises on the tibia and femur were documented, and patterns were classified according to the location of the bone bruise in the lateral-medial direction. The meniscal and bone bruise injury patterns and the specific bone bruise locations were compared between the soccer and basketball groups. Results: Overall, 138 patients were included (56 with soccer-related and 82 with basketball-related ACL injury). No significant difference between the groups was observed in bone bruise patterns (P =.743) or meniscal injury patterns (P =.952). Bone bruise on the lateral side only of both the femur and the tibia was the most common pattern in both soccer (41.9%) and basketball (47.0%) groups; the most common meniscal injury type was an isolated lateral meniscal injury in both soccer (50.0%) and basketball (45.0%) groups. For patients with bone bruises on both the lateral and the medial sides of both the femur and the tibia (BF+BT), the bone bruise signal intensity on the lateral side of the femur (P <.001) and tibia (P =.009) was significantly higher than that on the medial side for both groups. The bone bruises on the lateral side of the femur (P <.001) and tibia (P =.002) were significantly more anterior than those on the medial side for patients with the BF+BT pattern. Conclusion: No significant differences in bone bruise location or meniscal injury type were detected when comparing ACL injuries sustained during soccer versus basketball. The study results suggest a similar biomechanical loading pattern for ACL injuries in these sports. © The Author(s) 2021.","anterior cruciate ligament; bone bruise; magnetic resonance imaging; sport-specific","anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; basketball; basketball player; bone contusion; clinical effectiveness; cross-sectional study; femur; human; knee instability; major clinical study; meniscal repair; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; signal noise ratio; soccer; soccer player; sports medicine; tibia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104461227

In particular, sports that combine jumping and rapid changes in direction are associated with increased lower extremity injuries. Purpose: To describe the epidemiology of foot and ankle injuries in men’s and women’s jumping sports, including NCAA men’s and women’s basketball, women’s volleyball, and women’s gymnastics, during the 2009-2010 through 2013-2014 seasons. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Injury-surveillance data were obtained from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program for the 2009-2010 through 2013-2014 seasons. Injuries were examined by mechanism, activity during injury, and participation restriction time. Injury rates per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), injury rate ratios, and risk ratios with 95% CIs were calculated. Reported sex differences were calculated for men’s and women’s basketball. All 95% CIs not containing 1.0 were considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 1136 players sustained foot and ankle injuries (483 male and 653 female) over 612,680 AEs. These injuries resulted in a combined rate of 1.85 per 1000 AEs (95% CI, 1.75-1.97). Ankle sprains were the most common injury (63.7%), with lateral ligamentous complex injuries making up 77.1% of all ankle sprains. The most common foot injury varied based on sport and sex. Ankle injury rates were higher in male versus female basketball players (injury rate ratio, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.13-1.57]), but foot injury rates did not differ. Among basketball and volleyball players, player contact during jumping was the most common injury mechanism. Female gymnasts had higher overuse injury rates than other athletes (0.49/1000 AEs [95% CI, 0.30-0.74]; P <.002). Overall, female basketball players were 1.81 times more likely to sustain an overuse injury than male basketball players (95% CI, 1.02-3.20; P =.02). Conclusion: The most common foot and ankle injury sustained in collegiate jumping sports was a lateral ligamentous complex ankle sprain. Injury-prevention programs focusing on ankle flexibility, strength, and proprioception may help to alleviate the injury burden and lessen severity. Improving the anticipation of contact during jumping and landing may reduce injury rates and increase player safety. The increased prevalence of overuse injuries in female collegiate athletes competing in jumping sports necessitates further investigation to reduce injury rates through prevention and training programs. © The Author(s) 2021.","basketball; foot and ankle injuries; gymnastics; NCAA sports; volleyball","adult; ankle injury; ankle sprain; Article; athlete; basketball; basketball player; competition; controlled study; data analysis; descriptive research; disease severity; disease surveillance; electronic health record; female; foot injury; gymnast; gymnastics; health care organization; human; incidence; injury surveillance data; joint mobility; jumping athlete; knee function; major clinical study; male; national collegiate athletic association; player safety; prevalence; proprioception; safety; sex difference; sport injury; training; volleyball",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104389924

In particular, it could be important to assess oxidative stress markers in relation to the training load because the anaerobic path becomes predominant in high-intensity actions. Methods: Ten female professional basketball players, performing five 2 h-lasting training sessions per week, and 10 sedentary control women were investigated. Capillary blood and saliva samples were collected in the morning before the training session. The antioxidant capacity and the levels of reactive oxygen metabolites on plasma were determined measuring Reactive Oxygen Metabolite and Biological Antioxidant Potential (d-ROMs and the BAP Test). Salivary cortisol was detected by using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Results: The antioxidant capacity (BAP value) was significantly higher in elite basketball players (21.2%; p < 0.05). Conversely, cortisol (51%; p < 0.009) and the levels of oxidative species (d-ROM, 21.9%; p < 0.05) showed a significant decrease in elite athletes. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper observed 38 games and sixteen variables of standard efficiency during the FIBA EuroBasket Women 2019. Two regression models were obtained, a set of relative percentage and relative rating variables, which are used in the NBA league, where the dependent variable was the number of points scored. The obtained results show that in the first model, the difference between winning and losing teams was made by three variables: true shooting percentage, turnover percentage of inefficiency and efficiency percentage of defensive rebounds, which explain 97.3%, while for the second model, the distinguishing variables was offensive efficiency, explaining for 96.1% of the observed phenomenon. There is a continuity of the obtained results with the previous championship, played in 2017. Of all the technical elements of basketball, it is still the shots made, assists and defensive rebounds that have the most significant impact on the final score in European women’s basketball. It can be noted that, unlike with the previous championship, inside play is no longer dominant, but there is a balance between inside and outside play, which has already been established as a developing trend in men’s basketball. The emergence of the offensive efficiency variable indicates that it is becoming significant in top-tier competitions as well but is still a challenge for coaches to grasp the causes of this multicomplex issue based on this indicator. © 2021.

A total of 97 basketball players were tracked bi-annually over 3 consecutive years. Players were divided into two age-categories according to their age at baseline: under-12; and under-14. Technical skills were assessed using the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance test battery. Anthropometric, body composition, biological maturation and physical performance data were collected. Cohen’s kappa (κ) was used to estimate tracking. With the exception of defensive movement in the under-12 age-category, tracking was low in all skill tests for both under-12 (0.22 ≤ κ ≤ 0.33) and-14 (0.20 ≤ κ ≤ 0.26) groupings. The overall technical skill showed moderate tracking for under-12 players (κ = 0.47) and low tracking for under-14 players (κ = 0.26). At baseline, players who were consistently more skilled or became more skillful (in the under-12 age-category) over time had a better growth-motor performance profile and most of them were selected to be members of regional teams. In conclusion, tracking of individual skill trajectories was low-to-moderate. Moreover, a better growth-motor performance profile seems crucial to maintain high levels of skill performance over time. It is recommended that basketball coaches track the developmental trajectories of their players to better understand the erratic nature of skill development and help design more effective practice regimes. © 2021 by the authors.

Fifteen professional basketball players from a first-league European club were monitored throughout the season using the CR-10 Borg scale and the Hooper questionnaire. Weekly AL and acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) were weekly calculated for monitoring of the internal load. In addition, DOMS and fatigue values were weekly calculated. Greater AL, DOMS, and fatigue values were found during the early season, and the highest ACWR value was found during the second period. Overall, AL presented large correlations with DOMS (r=0.60) and fatigue (r=0.62). The results of this study indicate that load is higher in the first period and then decreases throughout the season. The results also showed that AL is more closely related to well-being parameters than ACWR. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.","Athletes; Basketball; Training; Workload",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103822495

The National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended active regular season play in 2020 after a player tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No previous studies have examined the impact of COVID-19 on return to play in the NBA. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to examine performance measures for NBA players who had recovered from COVID-19 and returned to play in the NBA bubble. We hypothesized that these athletes would play fewer minutes and have decreased performance statistics compared with performance during the 2019-2020 regular season prior to the lockdown and with career averages. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: NBA players positive for SARS-CoV-2 who played in both the 2019-2020 regular season and the NBA bubble were identified. Data collected included player demographics and player performance statistics. Results: A total of 20 players were included in the study. Players who had recovered from COVID-19 played significantly fewer minutes per game in the NBA bubble (25.8 vs 28.7; P =.04) and made fewer field goals per game (4.6 vs 5.4; P =.02) compared with the season prior to shutdown. While NBA bubble players demonstrated slight decreases in averages for points (P =.06), rebounds (P =.13), assists (P =.23), steals (P =.30), and blocks (P =.71) per game, these were not statistically significant. Aside from an increase in made free throws per game during the bubble (3.3 vs 2.8; P =.04), player performance was not significantly different from career averages. Conclusion: For players who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 prior to playing in the NBA bubble, the current study demonstrated that despite playing significantly fewer minutes per game, performance was not statistically different from either their pre-COVID 2019-2020 level of play or from their career averages. © The Author(s) 2021.","basketball; COVID-19; NBA bubble; SARS-CoV-2","adult; Article; athlete; athletic performance; basketball player; body weight; career; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; human; lockdown; outcome assessment; return to sport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103196816

Methods: The cohort comprised 35 healthy male volunteers aged 17 to 26 years. All the subjects were either basketball players (n=9), soccer players (n=12) or sedentary controls (n=14). Arterial stiffness was measured by the Pulse Trace System (Micro Medical Ltd., Rochester, UK) and echocardiographic images were taken using a commercially available machine (Vivid 7 GE-Vingmed, Horten, Norway) with a 2.5 MHz transducer. Results: The basketball players had significantly higher heights and body weights as compared to both the soccer players and the controls. The aortic elastic properties derived from the echocardiographic measurements did not differ between the groups. The peripheral pulse wave velocity measurements showed significantly lower values both in the basketball and soccer players compared to the controls, whereas the central pulse wave velocity measurement was significantly lower only in the basketball players as compared to the controls. No significant difference was seen between the basketball and soccer players.

Purpose: To evaluate the effect of Achilles tendon repair on game utilization, player performance, and career longevity in WNBA athletes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: WNBA players from 1997 to 2019 with a history of ATR (n = 12) were matched 1:2 to a healthy control group. Player characteristics, game utilization, and in-game performance data were collected for each athlete, from which the player efficiency rating (PER) was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed comparing postinjury data to preinjury baseline as well as cumulative career data. Changes at each time point relative to the preinjury baseline were also compared between groups. Results: Of the 12 players with ATR, 10 (83.3%) returned to play at the WNBA level at a mean (±SD) of 12.5 ± 3.3 months. Four players participated in only 1 WNBA season after injury. There were no differences in characteristics between the 10 players who returned to play after injury and the control group. After return to play, the WNBA players demonstrated a significant decrease in game utilization compared with preinjury, playing in 6.0 ± 6.9 fewer games, starting in 12.7 ± 15.4 fewer games, and playing 10.2 ± 9.1 fewer minutes per game (P <.05 for all). After the index date of injury, the players with Achilles repair played 2.1 ± 1.2 more years in the WNBA, while control players played 5.35 ± 3.2 years (P <.01) Additionally, the players with Achilles repair had a significant decrease in PER in the year after injury compared with preinjury (7.1 ± 5.3 vs 11.0 ± 4.4; P =.02). The reduction in game utilization and decrease in PER in these players was maintained when compared with the matched controls (P <.05 for both). Conclusion: The majority of WNBA players who sustained ATR were able to return to sport after their injury; however, their career longevity was shorter than that of healthy controls. There was a significant decrease in game utilization and performance in the year after return to play compared with healthy controls. © The Author(s) 2021.","Achilles rupture; basketball; female; performance; WNBA","achilles tendon rupture; adult; Article; assessment of humans; athletic performance; basketball; basketball player; career; clinical article; controlled study; female; game utilization; human; Player Efficiency Rating; retrospective study; sport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102900270

Based on the original “dual system” teaching mode of college sports talents, this study incorporated the LDTA model to optimize and adjust it, so as to establish a new college sports talent training system. In order to prove the feasibility of the new sports talent training system, after analyzing the market economy of the local social sports industry and the basic situation of students, this paper studies the application of the new sports talent training system to the practical teaching of physical education students in 2017 in university X from 2019 to the first half of 2020, and compares the final scores of the students under the original teaching mode and the new sports talent training system. At present, the students’ final scores under the new PE talent training system are generally higher than those under the original teaching mode. It is also found that for some practical skills courses, the students’ performance under the new PE talent training system is obviously better than that under the original teaching mode.

A chronic Achilles tendon rupture usually results from a neglected or misdiagnosed acute rupture, and about one-fifth of acute AT ruptures are missed and lead to chronic AT rupture. Although many techniques have been described, there is no gold standard in the treatment of chronic AT ruptures. Hypothesis: Endoscopically assisted, minimally invasive reconstruction for chronic AT rupture using a double-bundle flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon would result in improvement of the overall function, with a low rate of wound complications. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between May 2015 and November 2016, a total of 19 consecutive patients were enrolled and treated using endoscopically assisted, minimally invasive reconstruction for chronic AT rupture using a double-bundle FHL. The operative assessment comprised the Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score, the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score, the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles score, and a postoperative questionnaire. All postoperative complications were recorded. Results: The mean follow-up time for all patients was 31 months (range, 20-42 months). According to the postoperative questionnaire, the result of surgery was excellent in 8 (42%) of 19 patients, good in 10 (53%), and fair in 1 (5%). All clinical outcome scores (mean ± SD) improved significantly after surgery: Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score, 23.3 ± 10.3 vs 98.3 ± 9.2 (postoperatively vs preoperatively); American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society, 52.1 ± 12.4 vs 97.5 ± 18.9; and Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles, 23.4 ± 11.2 vs 95.7 ± 17.1 (P <.05). No complications with regard to wound healing or infection were noted. Twelve relatively young patients returned to preinjury activity levels, such as playing basketball or badminton, and the older patients were able to meet their daily needs, such as walking up stairs and jogging.

Accurate head impact exposure data obtained via head impact sensors may help identify appropriate strategies across sports and between genders to mitigate repetitive head impacts. Purpose: To quantify sport- and gender-based differences in head impact rate and mechanism for adolescents. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: High school female and male varsity soccer, basketball, lacrosse, and field hockey (female only) teams were instrumented with headband-mounted impact sensors during games over 2 seasons of soccer and 1 season of basketball, lacrosse, and field hockey. Video review was used to remove false-positive sensor-recorded events, and the head impact rate per athlete-exposure (AE) was calculated. Impact mechanism was categorized as equipment to head, fall, player to head, or head to ball (soccer only). Results: Male players had significantly higher head impact rates as compared with female players in soccer (3.08 vs 1.41 impacts/AE; rate ratio, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.8-2.6]), basketball (0.90 vs 0.25; 3.6 [2.6-4.6]), and lacrosse (0.83 vs 0.06; 12.9 [10.1-15.8]). Impact mechanism distributions were similar within sports between boys and girls. In soccer, head to ball represented 78% of impacts, whereas at least 88% in basketball were player-to-player contact. Conclusion: Across sports for boys and girls, soccer had the highest impact rate. Male high school soccer, basketball, and lacrosse teams had significantly higher head impact rates than did female teams of the same sport. For girls, basketball had a higher head impact rate than did lacrosse and field hockey, and for boys, basketball had a similar impact rate to lacrosse, a collision sport. Sport differences in the distribution of impact mechanisms create sport-specific targets for reducing head impact exposure. © The Author(s) 2021.","basketball; football (soccer); head injuries/concussion; injury prevention; lacrosse; pediatric sports medicine","accident prevention; algorithm; Article; athlete; basketball; cohort analysis; collision sport; concussion; exposure; false positive result; female; football; high school; hockey; hospitalization; human; lacrosse (sport); male; observational study; prospective study; sex difference; shoulder injury; soccer; sport; sport injury; videorecording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101957427

Medial patellar instability is rare and is a well-recognized iatrogenic complication of an overly aggressive lateral retinacular release. Noniatrogenic medial patellar dislocations are rare. The management of these injuries is not well described. Purpose: To describe the experience of the International Patellofemoral Study Group with patients with noniatrogenic medial patellar dislocation. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Members of the International Patellofemoral Study Group (N = 64) were surveyed between October 2018 and April 2019. This group was chosen because of its wide referral base and interest in patellar instability. Specialists who had encountered a patient with medial patellar instability were sent a questionnaire inquiring about details of the case, including patient demographics, medical history, level of athletic competition, injury characteristics, and treatment. Cases were confirmed by physical examination records and, in some cases, with findings on advanced radiographic imaging. Results: The survey response rate was 73% (47/64). Three of the 47 specialists (6.4%) reported they had seen a case of noniatrogenic medial patellar dislocation, for a total of 6 cases. Four cases were described as recurrent medial dislocations in the setting of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; 2 were treated nonoperatively, 1 underwent lateral patellofemoral ligament reconstruction, and 1 underwent derotational osteotomies. Two medial-sided patellar dislocations in collegiate athletes were sports-related injuries that required surgical debridement but no ligamentous reconstruction. None of the patients had persistent or recurrent instability at the time of their most recent follow-up. Conclusion: Noniatrogenic medial patellar dislocations are extremely rare. This case review suggests that the treatment of first-time medial patellar instability in patients without known risk factors should follow the same principles as the treatment of lateral instability with no known risk factors, which is nonoperative management. For patients with documented risk factors and recurrence, surgery to address the risk factors may be appropriate. © The Author(s) 2021.","collegiate athlete; lateral patellar dislocation; medial patellar dislocation; noniatrogenic","corticosteroid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adolescent; adult; arthroscopic chondroplasty; arthroscopic surgery; Article; basketball player; bone contusion; bone radiography; case report; child; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; Ehlers Danlos syndrome; femoral condyle; follow up; human; iatrogenic disease; knee function; knee injury; knee pain; lateral patellofemoral ligament; ligament surgery; noniatrogenic medial patellar dislocation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteotomy; patella dislocation; patellar cartilage restoration; patellar instability; patellofemoral joint; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; school child; surgical debridement; tibial tuberosity; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101854626

Current literature reports a high rate of return to play, but there are limited data on performance after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Purpose/Hypothesis: To determine return to play and player performance in the first and second seasons after ACLR in NBA players. We hypothesized that players would return at a high rate. However, we also hypothesized that performance in the first season after ACLR would be worse as compared with the preinjury performance, with a return to baseline by postoperative year 2. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: An online database of NBA athlete injuries between 2010 and 2019 was queried using the term ACL reconstruction. For the included players, the following data were recorded: name; age at injury; position; height, weight, and body mass index; handedness; NBA experience; dates of injury, surgery, and return; knee affected; and postoperative seasons played. Regular season statistics for 1 preinjury season and 2 postoperative seasons were compiled and included games started and played, minutes played, and player efficiency rating. Kaplan-Meier survivorship plots were computed for athlete return-to-play and retirement endpoints. Results: A total of 26 athletes underwent ACLR; of these, 84% (95% CI, 63.9%-95.5%) returned to play at a mean 372.5 days (95% CI, 323.5-421.5 days) after surgery. Career length after injury was a mean of 3.36 seasons (95% CI, 2.27-4.45 seasons). Factors that contributed to an increased probability of return to play included younger age at injury (odds ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.47-0.92]; P =.0337) and fewer years of experience in the NBA before injury (odds ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.45-0.93]; P =.0335). Postoperatively, athletes played a significantly lower percentage of total games in the first season (48.4%; P =.0004) and second season (62.1%; P =.0067) as compared with the preinjury season (78.5%). Player efficiency rating in the first season was 19.3% less than that in the preinjury season (P =.0056). Performance in the second postoperative season was not significantly different versus preinjury. Conclusion: NBA players have a high rate of RTP after ACLR. However, it may take longer than a single season for elite NBA athletes to return to their full preinjury performance. Younger players and those with less NBA experience returned at higher rates. © The Author(s) 2021.","ACL; ACLR; NBA; performance; player efficiency rating; return to play","adult; age; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; athlete; basketball player; body height; body mass; body weight; career; handedness; human; knee injury; longevity; postoperative period; probability; reconstructive surgery; sport injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101840753

The rate of return to the preinjury level of sport activities after ACL reconstruction continues to evolve. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to determine the return-to-sport rate after ACL reconstruction in a cohort of National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes in different sports. It was hypothesized that, with intensive supervision of rehabilitation, the return-to-sport rate would be optimal. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 75 collegiate athletes from a single institution who had undergone unilateral or bilateral ACL reconstruction between 2001 and 2013 and participated in an extensive supervised rehabilitation program. Prospectively collected athlete data as well as data about preinjury exposure, associated lesions, surgical technique, time lost to injury, number of games missed, time to return to full sport activity or retire, and subsequent surgical procedures were extracted from the medical and athletic trainer records. Results: The 75 patients (40 male, 35 female; mean age, 20.1 years) underwent 81 reconstruction procedures (73 primary, 8 revision). The mean follow-up was 19.3 months. The overall return-to-sport rate was 92%. After reconstruction, 9 athletes (12%) retired from collegiate sports, but 3 of them returned to sport activities after graduation. Overall, 8 athletes (11%) experienced an ACL graft retear. Conclusion: The return-to-sport rate in our National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes compared favorably with that reported in other studies in the literature. The strict follow-up by the surgeon, together with the high-profile, almost daily technical and psychological support given mainly by the athletic trainers during the recovery period, may have contributed to preparing the athletes for a competitive rate of return to sport at their preinjury level. © The Author(s) 2021.","activity level; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; collegiate athletes; return to sport","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; athlete; athletic trainer; basketball player; body mass; cohort analysis; female; follow up; football player; grip strength; hamstring tendon; human; knee function; knee instability; major clinical study; male; physical activity; prevalence; retrospective study; return to sport; shoulder injury; sport injury; sports medicine; student athlete; surgeon; surgical technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101250259

Comprehensive data regarding injury patterns and rates in these athletes are limited. Purpose: To summarize available data on orthopaedic and sports medicine–related injuries through 2020 in professional female and male basketball players. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A search was conducted using PubMed and Embase through April 5, 2020, to identify injury studies regarding WNBA and NBA players. Studies were included if the injury or surgery was considered a direct consequence of game play including musculoskeletal/orthopaedic, concussion, ophthalmologic, and craniomaxillofacial injuries. Systematic reviews, screening studies, or studies without sufficient WNBA or NBA player subgroup analysis were excluded. Results: A total of 49 studies met inclusion criteria, 43 (87.8%) of which detailed musculoskeletal injuries. The lower extremity represented 63.3% of studies. A majority (59.2%) of studies were level 4 evidence. The source of data was primarily comprehensive online search (n = 33; 67.3%), followed by official databases (n = 11; 22.4%). Only 3 studies concerned WNBA athletes compared with 47 that concerned NBA athletes. The lowest return-to-play rates were cited for Achilles tendon repairs (61.0%-79.5%). Variability in return-to-play rates existed among studies even with similar seasons studied. Conclusion: The majority of literature available on orthopaedic and sports medicine–related injuries of NBA and WNBA athletes is on the lower extremity. The injuries that had the greatest effect on return to play and performance were Achilles tendon ruptures and knee cartilage injuries treated using microfracture.

Serial CMR was performed prior to and following clinical stabilization after treatment for suspected myocarditis. The initial CMR exam showed mildly thickened mid left ventricular septum with mild hyperintensity lesion on T2-weighted image (T2WI). There was enhancement in subepicardial mid inferoseptal wall and right ventricular insertion on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image. A subsequent CMR exam after resolution of symptoms and normalization of cardiac markers demonstrated diffuse mid and subepicardial edema of left ventricle on T2WI.

Previous studies suggest that physical exercising may effectively reduce smartphone users' addiction levels. Comparisons and further evaluations on the long-term effects of different types of exercise-based interventions on treating PSU remain to be investigated. Objective. We investigated if group-based basketball and Baduanjin exercise (a type of Qigong) would reduce PSU and improve the mental health of college students and whether such effects would be sustained. A twelve-week experiment was conducted, where 96 eligible Chinese college students with PSU were randomly assigned to two intervention arms (i.e., basketball and Baduanjin exercises) and a control arm. Outcome measures, including PSU (measured by the Mobile Phone Addiction Index in Chinese (MPAI)) and mental health indices for anxiety (measured by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SRAS)), loneliness (measured by the short-form of the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS)), inadequacy (measured by the revised Janis and Field's Feelings of Inadequacy Scale (FIS)), and stress (measured by the Chinese version of Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS)) were collected at the baseline, the end of week 12, and the two-month follow-up. A Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model for longitudinal data was utilized in analyses. Results. Both exercise interventions demonstrated significant effects on decreasing PSU (basketball: p<0.01; Baduanjin: p<0.01), feelings of anxiety (basketball: p<0.01; Baduanjin: p=0.04), loneliness (basketball: p<0.01; Baduanjin: p<0.01), inadequacy (basketball: p<0.01; Baduanjin: p<0.01), and perceived stress (basketball: p<0.01; Baduanjin: p=0.04), at the end of interventions. At two months after interventions, both exercise interventions demonstrated significant effects on decreasing PSU (basketball: p<0.05; Baduanjin: p<0.05), feelings of anxiety (basketball: p<0.01; Baduanjin: p=0.03), loneliness (basketball: p<0.01; Baduanjin: p<0.01), and inadequacy (basketball: p<0.01; Baduanjin: p=0.01), but not for feeling of stress. Furthermore, group-based basketball demonstrated larger improvements for all these significant results on reducing PSU and meanwhile improving their related mental health parameters among college students. © 2021 Tao Xiao et al.",,"adult; anxiety; Article; basketball; cell phone use; Chinese; college student; controlled study; craving; demography; exercise; female; follow up; human; loneliness; male; mental health; mobile phone addiction; normal human; outcome assessment; Perceived Stress Scale; physiological stress; qigong; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; Self-rating Anxiety Scale; treatment outcome; UCLA Loneliness Scale; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100626759

While these studies were rigorous in their protocol and methodology, no efforts in recent literature have been made to identify if these reference scores apply to elite athletes. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in the baseline scores of elite athletes versus the general population. We hypothesized that athletes’ PROMIS upper extremity general function (PROMIS-UE) and general physical function (PROMIS-PF) scores would vary substantially from the mean health state of the general population. We further hypothesized that these scores would be affected by specific sport and level of competition Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Three PROMIS computer adaptive test (CAT) domains were administered to elite athlete (≥18 years) volunteers (either in person or through email). An elite athlete was defined as one participating in sports at the collegiate level or higher. Test domains included PROMIS-PF, PROMIS-UE, and pain interference (PROMIS-PI). PROMIS domain t scores were defined and assessed against NIH reference values to identify significant differences. Distribution analysis was conducted using histograms and normality assessments. Domains were also subject to correlation analysis. Finally, subgroup analysis was conducted for all athlete characteristics to identify any factors associated with variance. Results: In total, 196 elite athletes (mean age, 21.1 years; range, 18.0-36.7 years) completed all 3 PROMIS-CAT forms. Overall, the mean scores were 56.0 ± 6.4, 58.1 ± 7.7, and 47.1 ± 7.3 for PROMIS-UE, PROMIS-PF, and PROMIS-PI, respectively. Distribution analysis showed nonnormal distribution for all 3 PROMIS domains (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P <.001). Similarly, in all 3 PROMIS domains the athletes displayed more disparate scores than the NIH-reported reference values (1-way sign test, P <.001). Only the presence of pain and sport played showed association with variance in PROMIS domain scores (P <.001 and P =.003, respectively). Conclusion: Elite athletes displayed more disparate reference scores than the NIH-reported average of 50 for PROMIS-UE, PROMIS-PF, and PROMIS-PI. Furthermore, these forms were sensitive to varying levels of sport among collegiate athletes. © The Author(s) 2021.","athlete; baseball; basketball; football; PROMIS","adult; Article; athlete; athletics; basketball; body mass; competition; cross-sectional study; e-mail; female; health status; health survey; human; human experiment; information system; knee function; major clinical study; male; national health organization; normal human; orthopedic surgery; pain assessment; patient-reported outcome; physical activity; questionnaire; sport; training; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100507044

However, data on head injuries in non-tackle football are sparse, particularly among youth participants. Purpose: To describe the epidemiology of emergency department visits for head injuries due to non-tackle football among youth players in the United States and compare the data with basketball, soccer, and tackle football. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Injury data from 2014 to 2018 were obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database. Injury reports coded for patients aged 6 to 18 years and associated with basketball, football, or soccer were extracted. Data were filtered to include only injuries to the head region, specifically, the head, ear, eyeball, mouth, or face. Football injuries were manually assigned to “non-tackle” or “tackle” based on the injury narratives. Sports & Fitness Industry Association data were used to estimate annual sport participation and calculate annual injury rates per 100,000 participant-years. Results: A total of 26,770 incident reports from 2014 to 2018 were analyzed. For head region injuries in non-tackle football, the head was the most commonly injured body part, followed by the face; the most common diagnosis was a laceration, followed by concussion and internal injury (defined as an unspecified head injury or internal head injury [eg, subdural hematoma or cerebral contusion]). The most common contacting object was another player. The projected national rate of head region injuries was lowest for non-tackle football across the 4 sports. In particular, the projected rate of injuries to the head for non-tackle football (78.0 per 100,000 participant-years) was less than one-fourth the rates for basketball (323.5 per 100,000 participant-years) and soccer (318.2 per 100,000 participant-years) and less than one-tenth the rate for tackle football (1478.6 per 100,000 participant-years). Conclusion: Among youth in the United States aged 6 to 18 years who were treated in the emergency department for injuries related to playing non-tackle football, the most common diagnosis for injuries to the head region was a laceration, followed by a concussion. Head region injuries associated with non-tackle football occurred at a notably lower rate than basketball, soccer, or tackle football. © The Author(s) 2021.","concussion; epidemiology; head; injury surveillance; non-tackle football","adolescent; Article; athlete; athletic trainer; baseball; basketball; child; concussion; contusion; female; fitness; football; football player; head injury; hematoma; human; human experiment; injury; laceration; male; prevalence; shoulder injury; soccer; tooth injury; traumatic brain injury; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100479014

The study aimed to verify the common national available reference intervals (RIs) for common inflammatory and screening coagulation tests in a population of healthy young female at-hletes. Materials and methods: One hundred and twenty-one female athletes (age range: 16–34), from various sports disciplines (water polo, handball, volleyball, football, basketball), were included in the study. All participants completed the international physical activity short-form questionnaire. Blood samples were collected between 8–10 am, after an overnight fast, before any physical activity. Reference intervals were determined according to Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute EP28-A3C Guidelines. Results: Calculated RIs for white blood cell count (WBC), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio were in accordance with the common national RIs. Calculated RI for C-reactive protein (CRP) was lower (< 2.9 mg/L) than the proposed cut-off for a healthy population (< 5.0 mg/L). Reference interval for fibrinogen was higher (1.9–4.4 g/L), than the available RIs (1.8–3.5 g/L). D-dimer cut-off value was set at 852 µg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU), higher than the proposed 500 µg/L FEU for venous thromboembolism (VTE) exclusion. Conclusions: The applicability of the available RIs for WBC count, PT, and APTT-ratio was confirmed. However, RIs for CRP and fibrinogen differed significantly than the available common national RIs for the healthy non-athletes’ population. A higher cut-off for D-dimers should be extensively verified before implementation for VTE diagnosis exclusion in a group of healthy young female athletes. © 2021, Biochemia Medica, Editorial Office.

However, such visual tools may impose substantial demands on the learner’s cognitive resources that are very limited in current knowledge. Cognitive load theory has been used to improve learning from dynamic visualizations by providing different instructional designs to manage learner cognitive load. This paper reviews a series of experimental studies assessing the effects of certain instructional designs on learning of tactical scenes of play through dynamic visualizations. An electronic database search was performed on the Web of Science and PubMed/Medline databases from inception to July 2020 using a combination of relevant keywords. Manual searches were also made. The search was limited to English language. A total of 515 records were screened by two researchers using the Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome(s) (PICO) criteria. The quality and validity of the included studies were assessed using “QualSyst”. Learning indicators in students and/or players (male and female) at any age category and competitive level were considered. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, which focused on the effects of four instructional designs (i.e., using static visualizations, employing sequential presentation, applying segmentation, and decreasing presentation speed) on learning various game systems through dynamic visualizations. These studies indicate that (i) the effectiveness of all instructional designs depend upon the level of learners’ expertise when learning soccer/Australian football scenes through animations/videos, (ii) the effectiveness of using static visualizations instead of animations/videos showing soccer/basketball scenes depend upon the type of the depicted knowledge (i.e., motor knowledge or descriptive knowledge) for novice learners, (iii) the effectiveness of employing static visualizations and decreasing presentation speed when learning soccer/basketball scenes from animations/videos depend upon the level of content complexity, for novice learners. The current review demonstrated important practical implications for both coaches and physical education teachers using either animations and/or videos to communicate game systems. Indeed, findings suggested that adapting instructional designs to the level of learners’ expertise, type of depicted knowledge, and level of content complexity is a crucial part of effective tactical learning from dynamic visualizations. © 2020 by the authors.

Hypothesis: NBA players will be able to return to preinjury playing status after treatment of OLTs by arthroscopic debridement alone without marrow-stimulating techniques. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Between the 2000 and 2015 seasons, 10 NBA players were treated with arthroscopic debridement of an OLT. The following performance outcomes were compared pre- and postoperatively: seasons played, games played, games started, minutes per game, points per game, field goals, 3-point shots, rebounds, assists, double doubles, triple doubles, steals, blocks, turnovers, personal fouls, assists per turnovers, steals per turnovers, NBA rating, scoring efficiency, and shooting efficiency. In addition, the players were compared with a matched control group using mixed effects regression and Fisher least significant difference modeling. Results: All 10 players returned to play in the NBA after arthroscopic debridement without microfracture or drilling of an OLT. When compared with preoperative performance, postoperative mean points scored, assists made, and steals made increased by 2.86 (P =.042), 0.61 (P =.049), and 0.15 (P =.027), respectively. Only field goal percentage decreased postoperatively when compared with matched controls; however, this normalized by the end of the second season after surgery. There was no statistically significant change in any of the other performance factors when compared with matched controls. All patients returned to basketball during the same season (n = 1) or the following season (n = 9) if the operation was performed off-season. The mean length of career after surgery was 4.1 years, with 5 players still playing in the league at the time of this study. Conclusion: After arthroscopic debridement of an OLT without drilling or microfracture, there was a high rate of return to the NBA, with improved points scored, assists, and steals made after surgery when compared with preoperative performance. There was no statistically significant change in any performance factors when compared with uninjured matched controls. Lesion size did not affect player career length. These data should be used to manage patients’ and teams’ expectations regarding players’ ability to return to elite levels of athletic performance after surgery of an OLT. © The Author(s) 2021.","National Basketball Association; NBA players; OCD; osteochondral lesions of the talus; return to sport","adult; ankle injury; ankle instability; arthroscopic debridement; Article; athletic performance; basketball; body mass; bone marrow edema; career mobility; cartilage injury; clinical article; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; electrostimulation; exercise; hemispheric dominance; human; ice massage; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteochondral lesion; outcome assessment; pain; physiotherapy; postoperative period; preoperative period; range of motion; rebound; return to sport; scoring system; season; sport injury; talus; turnover rate; weight bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098863622

The objective of this research was to interpret the perception and attribution of the students about the positive emotions for the subjective well-being during the practice of basketball in Physical Education, depending on the type of motor task, gender and educational center. To approach the emotional phenomenon, it has been decided to use a qualitative methodology. 20 girls and 24 boys from two educational centers in the Community of Madrid participated. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews and personal diaries, which have been subjected to a deductive-inductive content analysis with the help of the Atlas.ti 7.5 software. The results indicated 18 emotional codes or attributions found for joy, enthusiasm, security and fun. According to the type of motor task, gender and educational center, differences and similarities are identified, highlighting the role of competition and the relationship with a basketball sports culture in each educational center. It is concluded that, to promote the subjective well-being of the students in the practices of basketball in Physical Education, it could be appropriate to apply alternative teaching models of sport, adaptive strategies and a climate of achievement oriented to the task. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF).","Affectivity; Basketball; Gender; Physical education; Sports culture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092221781
